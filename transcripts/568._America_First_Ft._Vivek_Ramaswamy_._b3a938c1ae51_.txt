What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lies the thickness and Delusions of modern society and welcome to mother fucking reality guys today we have an awesome show for you It would normally be CTI but we have a special special edition of a we'll call it CTI okay you'll find out in a second Um as always uh make sure you remember to pay the fee I'm gonna get right into the show we have a special guest here today Uh Mr. Vivek Ramaswamy that's how good to see you it's good to see you too thanks for coming through I love that slow go But pay the fee don't be a ho share the show Yeah, that's that's it I like that it land but not so there wouldn't a tag line with the show I said that's the fucking tag line I guess it's a hashtag it's listen the people We all love the people here. We don't have no that's good. Yeah, we ain't got a whole to it. Yeah, no holds over here So as I mentioned guys um You know we're gonna do something a little bit different today and I'll let DJ kind of bring this up But uh Before before we get into that I just want to say man. I really appreciate you coming on the show. I think what you're doing um It's a very important. I like the fact and how you're doing it You know you're coming around to the podcast circuit you're speaking to the people directly you're having hard conversations And whether people agree or disagree Uh Everybody should respect that I think it's the best I think it's the best thing that I've seen From any politician and I know you're not a politician. You're not a panor um But I think that's the way it's gonna be from now until the future I think you we're gonna have to get out here. We're gonna have to talk with the real people and answer some real questions and um I'm looking forward to having a good conversation with you man. I'm pretty excited about it I think one of the things that's worked for me is if you get too attached to saying that I mean first of all I don't relish the idea of being in the White House Yeah, right? It's something I volunteered to do But if you start fetishizing it you attach yourself to that and you say okay Well, what do I say to get there? I look at it the other way. I'm gonna tell the people in this country who I am And what I stand for and if they like me they can vote for me Well, if they don't I'm fine with that they can go with somebody else as long as they know the truth and I'm good with that Isn't that the point of Political office. I mean, yes, aren't we supposed to return to An idea that is supposed to be of service, right? Like you had a pretty nice life a very nice life You've done some pretty nice things. You're very financially successful man and Just like the military when you sacrifice to join the military and you know you give up certain things and certain time periods of your life That's what we're missing in politics as well And I think so and I think so and I think that I hope that many of the people who are working in a government bureaucracy That that also isn't what they're doing for the rest of their life, right? Part of why I want eight-year term limits for anybody who works in the federal government Not just the elected people, but even the people reporting into me. Yeah And certainly that's a different vision of a culture of what the relationship is between citizens There's a period of time when you serve great focus on service Get the heck out and don't don't turn that into a career Yeah, because that then becomes about turning service into self-interest you want to do self-interest do it do it as a capitalist Yeah, do it the way we're made to do it. So I think that there are phases of life I wasn't one of those people who Served in the military when I graduated from college that just wasn't where my headspace was My dad grew up not with a lot of money my mom and dad both working class family in southwest Ohio He went through layoffs at GE under jack welches 10 years. So You know my headspace when I graduated was Tell me more about that jack welch guy Okay, I'm kind of interested in In seeing whether I break outside of the mold That even my parents wanted me to just focus on a stable career that he'd be an entrepreneur was Outside of the comfort zone for what they had envisioned for me But for me that was where I wanted to make it I've done that now yeah, and now I'm in a different phase of my life to say how do we create The American dream that you've lived I mean you're a young person you've succeeded at scale right how do we make that story Normal for the next generation And I think it takes somebody who's lived a life like you or I has to be able to say we're gonna go in for a short time God knows I don't want to do this for long, but we'll go do it for eight years Revive the country that we grew up in maybe one even greater than the one we grew up in and then pass the torch on to somebody else That's the way I look at it We are perfectly aligned in that in that idea I believe a hundred percent that we need people who have actually accomplished things who have done things outside Political office to lend their skill set lend their time to the country And it's time of need and and I think that anybody who's watching you right now If they're honest with themselves that's refreshing dude, you know whether whether they like Everything that you say or or they have you know theories about this or that the reality is is we're we've run it We live in a country with a very fat bloated old and title government where it's become The norm for people to go to office in order to get on in on the inside deal or to make personal wealth And what we really need is some of these other guys out here say you know at least starting to speak up at least starting to get engaged And not just you know sip in their my ties on their on their beachfront property, right? We could all be doing right now. Yeah, I mean that gets you know in a certain sense that also for me at least I get I got restless going through that period in my life and then you bring two sons into this world that changes your perspective Mm-hmm There's more to life than the aimless passage of to sure. It sounds like We're put it that's prison and that prison could be in a beachfront mansion that prison could be in You know in a tough lower income working class neighborhood in the inner city. Yeah It's almost like the circumstance doesn't actually matter. It's the mentality with which you approach your purpose at least for me Mm-hmm. I don't need sleep when I'm guided by my sense of purpose. Yeah, right. Yeah, and I think that that's part of what Our how old are you getting your best alert me. Yeah, so we're cut from similar, you know age vintage I think that people are age especially and younger Are badly in need of a cause right now. Yeah, like we have no sense of Purpose and direction and meaning I'm saying broadly as a generation We have a chance to revive that and I think much of what I'm up against or at least much of what I've been complaining about Let's put it this way over the last several years Wokeism climate ideology gender ideology pick your favorite poison. Yeah It's a substitute for You know pick your other favorites faith patriotism hard work family When those things disappear we need to latch on to something and Especially young people were latching on to whatever served to us not because we like what they're serving us But because we're desperate for something And so I think there's an opportunity and I only got familiar with you know what you're doing Yeah, but but but there's a sense in which even Your own self worth reviving that self confidence through fitness through hard work Through achieving something in the world that you create that didn't exist before that can fill the vacuum for somebody else Traditional faith belief in this country that there is a nation built on ideals that I pledge allegiance to that nation That I have two parents and or children and I'm married That that's a stable family foundation that guides my purpose whatever is we're gonna need You know the way I'll say faith family self worth Patriotism right Big two Yeah, but it can't be zero Or else you're lost and you're gonna latch on to something without realizing that you're subscribing to a new religion Yeah, and that's exactly what's happening in the country's people think they're not religious When in fact they've just adopted these deeply religious convictions Yeah, and that's the most dangerous kind of religion of all is when you're subscribing to religion when you don't admit to yourself That you actually are that's what's going on in much of our modern culture. Yeah in the United States I think I think you're hitting on a very very important point that's going on with the culture You know when you and I were growing up We had those things right like yeah, we had we were taught You know pledge allegiance we were taught the American values We were taught things like go out and win go out and build things Yes, be of service be useful right totally and we we absorb these things And we created purpose and you know you and I have both executed and and I think you know We've got a lot we've gotten further in a short amount of time than a lot of people getting their whole lives at that game. Yeah, but You know purpose changes and purpose shifts and for for me and I think for you too obviously with what you're doing with your actions you know the idea of Leading by example has to run It runs through me dude like when I look at what's going on with our I would say lost generation right now, you know it definitely comes down to a lack of Pride a lack of Identity as American culture Um, and I think that's been intentionally Installed I think that's something that yeah, I mean I think I think it goes so so the I kind of View it I've read it like 90% similarly to that I think there definitely is an intentional installment agenda going on in this country often comes in acronyms You know my general views if it comes in acronym be skeptical ESG CBDC UN It's W H O right because if it's an acronym, it's designed to be boring for a reason They don't want you to pay attention to it And I've written books about the stuff my first book Woking because about the merger of what I call state power and corporate power or the woke industrial complex to do what neither can on its own victimhood culture my third book was about the ESG movement We can talk about the different top down forces the COVID agenda the climate agenda now in in I would say more nefarious and lasting form But here's the thing that trick only works If you have a culture Individuals that are lost that are willing to buy up what they're selling right if you don't bend the need of the real thing Yeah, you have to remove you have been the need is something yeah, you first have to remove something and then replace it with something else Right, but this removal in some ways is the individual responsibility because I've moved a little bit from where I was a couple of years ago Just complaining about the way that they're removing it. How about taking a look in the mirror Right, I mean, I think that the question is If we take a long hard look in the mirror, I think we have to ask ourselves what is it inside each of us that makes us want to bend the knee I took my son to Washington DC's three and a half years old. That's a good question. It's interesting And so we're in June it's pride month. We're walking around Washington DC in in the evening Okay Capital of the United States and we tell you made the reference to pledging allegiance I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. That's what we grew up saying Every morning in school. We don't do that anymore You walk around Washington DC in the month of June. I kid you not We saw more trans flags not just the You know rainbow gay rights flag. No the trans the new trans gender flag this week's flavor and Ukraine flags right Versus the US flag in the United States capital think about that. There were combined a combined basis more flags for the nation of Ukraine And for the transgender movement then there were for the United States of America So there's a very real sense we require these symbols right so if you don't pledge allegiance to that flag It's not some like abstract analogy. We literally pick other flags. That's right to pledge allegiance to the trans flag And particularly what I think is going on this weird thing in the United States I don't know where you are on this but the weird religiosity around Ukraine. I think is oh we got it I think it's fucking absurd take it for this but I know I think it's absurd We shouldn't be sit look man Go to San Francisco go to Los Angeles go to go to downtown St. Louis. Yeah, go to all these cities The fact that we're sending a fucking dollar to anyone else is absurd right now. It is it is criminal Yeah, I think it's literally criminal because in this particular case I believe it is a repayment for a bribe of the son of a sitting US president Absolutely But but the reason within that we could beg the question why the Republicans are going along with it and it is this deeper Muscle memory that we have built dating back to the Iraq war that you make up for your own insecurity at home By projecting an artificial strength abroad Fighting a war that you're destined to lose But then just define it after the fact is that you want that's what it is or do you think it's that these dudes are on fucking payroll man They're on I mean yeah, I'm so this is a democratic like these Democratic issues definitely on payroll There's a lot in the Republican side that are on payroll Actually, just look at some of the other um, you know, look at some of the other candidates how they made multiple campaigns Or who gets to be a military contractor after their short stint in the UN Yeah, and goes from being in debt to making eight million bucks Yeah, off-reading a military contractor me on the board of Boeing to Lockheed Martin to you name it So that's like 75% but I but I believe in getting to the truth and it is weird. I have to tell you Unless unless there are facts. I don't know there are donors. I've lost like potential big backers and donors That's supposedly what you need to win a presidential race, but it is what it is. I'm gonna stick to saying what I believe Who I don't think like I have no basis to believe Have direct financial interests that benefit from the war And yet the one position the third rail that stops them from being able to support me They love my you know domestic policies and deregulation and shite you shutting down administrative state They'll get me behind all that they'll be with me on the anti woke message But when I tell them we're done paying To defend an invasion across somebody else's border when we have an invasion across our own southern border here at home To say that no no no no This is this is the third rail. I can't support you with that kind of position on Ukraine Like I first my reactions I mean definitely the Biden families compromised and this is a repayment of a bribe right Even many of the neocons in the republican establishment These are people who are looking in the name of running for president their next board gig on Lockheed Martin or or Raytheon or whatever But there's a subset of people very wealthy people that don't need More money and I don't think are directly making money off this war, but have this still imperialist Bone in their body that they just can't let go of yeah, and I think it relates to a sort of ego deficit actually when you lose your true sense of self-worth You start actually Creating your sense of self-worth from artificial things and this idea that I'm at the top of the food chain In the United States of America it better darn well be the country That's projecting its strength through fighting foreign wars somewhere that I'm not gonna go to yeah The my kids aren't gonna go to yeah, but that somebody else's kids are the peasant the peasant class kids They're gonna go by these wars like I can flex my muscle while I'm at the beach house. Yeah, I think there's an element of that Like if we're getting I can see that it's like we just the Lindsey Graham's psychology. You totally yeah You see Lindsey Graham go there and say the best money we ever spent kill a bunch of russians. Yeah, bro That's bullshit and not Americans don't feel that way Make us don't feel that way no way we're over here like Fuck you fight this war bro. Yeah, you're gonna go fight this like nobody wants this I sent Lindsey Graham to the front lines Yeah, they all deserve to go for wise I mean, yeah, they believe in the war. Hey listen, let him stand for it. I totally agree with that. All right. I'm liking you more and more I give Lindsey Graham some credit if he were willing to go you know teach him how to go go Yeah, go teach him how to operate those weapons do it in the front line. Yeah, yeah He does have a commission. I he's I think he's Air Force was there wrong? He's definitely in favor of he said it's the best money we've ever spent. I think it's the best foreign trip We'll ever send a US Senator on it's the best money we ever spent Pay for his flight to go out there. Yeah, this fucking dude look dude these guys Are literally treating the American people as if we are the ATM for their conquest and their bullshit deals that they're Doing all over the world. Well, we are their ATM. Yeah, I know bro Why are we sending like not only do we pay half of our income to these people and when we add it up Let's be real. It's more than half all right that makes us slaves these These people are Sending your kids and your sons and your daughters and the name of this patriotic delusion to go die like this It's absurd. I just posted a video of The the Gold Star families on my Instagram dude. That was that was heartbreaking to watch Like how can you watch that and not understand what these people think of us? When I say us dude, I come from the same class everybody else listen here. I'm not part of their team, right? I might have a couple dollars You know the vex got a few dollars. We we But like dude, we're not part of their crew And like these people see us the people as their way to finance their way to get wealthy and Their soldiers to fight their wars and this is absurd dude. This is not what we're here to do And you know the funny thing is there's this mythology around it too, right? If you if you rewind two three years ago Even the mainstream New York time style media was talking about the fact that Ukraine has some serious Nazi issues. Yeah domestically Okay, this is a guy You know this pipe hyper a hamlin and cargo pants that somehow has become an American god substitute for a modern religion is we have So who needs who needs god and you have Zelensky? Yeah, you know is is a guy who is actually shut down 11 opposition parties He is a guy who has Consolidated all media into one state media arm and he is trying to chain gang us Into a war right yeah He's rooting for world war because I mean say what you will about the guy you know comedian and cargo pants He still is doing what might be in his own self interest and arguably what he thinks of as his job If you chain gang these guys into war then at least that's good for Ukraine But the problem is in some ways it's not even I'm making complain about Zelensky and point all of his hypocrisy is all we want He goes back to that question easy to point the finger at the other what the heck is going on in this country That makes us fall for this trick Right we say we had the 99 people for a bro I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm we're not what but yet we have put in class we both parties Let's be honest, but dude Democrats and Republicans if there's one thing they agree on right now Okay, the worst ideas are by party. Yeah, but that's not the people Well, the people need to step up and do something I agree I'm the only person on that debate degree Who I mean, I'm on there with eight Republicans. Yeah, and I'm one out of eight on that stage Standing for what you and I are saying so the people better rise up and make this happen Or else we have a farce of two different political parties who we claim or vehemently disagreeing get of a pissing contest Who's more anti woke? That's a side show compared to where we're actually sending our actual dollars So yeah better be an uprising, which is what we need in this country listen dude you you're a business guy How many how many lawyers have you been around a lot many many? We know the game with lawyers and the game with lawyers is very simple They pretend to be enemies they go play golf and they talk about how they're gonna fuck out all your money It's actually good point that is the whole game. It's actually good point You know what they say when you get a lawsuit regular like you got hey Do not call the other guy no, I know what you do don't call them and then you know how you solve shit You call the dude. I know. Yeah exactly. It's station millions of out because you disintermediate the middle cut You know who else is like this actually this is a new one that my eyes got open to The world of political consultants actually they like that too right? Oh, oh totally. It's just it's just mercenaries right in the middle Salesforce and so and so yeah totally yeah, and so the guy who will running some of the big super packs of the other guys will be like You know three weeks before is like at my house like you know still have a text message relationship, you know pass a long stuff Yeah, it's a game. It's a farce. Yeah, it's a bunch of mercenaries like and backstabbers to bro Because the minute you don't go with them or the minute you don't totally they're all the sudden they're sending a press release At least yeah, yeah, yeah, it's exactly it's vicious dude It's a good point that in a certain way that's kind of what's going on at the governmental level As well But anyway this I do think this will be what separates the boys from the men in the Republican Party is our willingness to defect from the Superpack puppet class on the question of Ukraine right now and it was not Ukraine now to be some other war You know, it was before to be another one tomorrow. What's that you know? Want to China? You know, I mean, I think that the things I've said I mean they're they're raining arrows on me right now for a reason, but I'm speaking truth Yeah, and you know what if and I'm not some Just isolationist for the Jacobine isolation if somebody's attacking us on our turf You know what I'm not okay with the Chinese spy balloon flying over half this country. Okay, if you're gonna Attack the homeland Compromise our actual sovereignty on the homeland you better have hell to pay for it But the irony is we look the other way when that's happening right here at home We're in a modern opium war which I think is also a big problem that's a big part of intentionality of it's not drug addiction. It's fentanyl Art officially laced into per cassette that gets old via Snapchat. It's coming from Wuhan to Mexican drug cartels These are issues that I'm very open to talking about how we handle But we're deflecting that instead by focusing on You know, let's be real dude. Let's let's be fucking real first of all Zelensky is a puppet all right He is the frontman for the world economic form global communist movement. That's the that we'll talk about that You guys are not saying you guys get into it. Yeah, listen He's the frontman. Yeah, the reason he's an actor is because he's actually an actor. He's literally an actor. Yeah And the reality of what's going on in the world is we have a compromise president who's taken millions of dollars To make policy decisions that are not in the interests of the American people they are in the interest of China and other countries and that's why we have an open border and that's why we have crime wave and that's why we have All this crazy shit going on This family sold out absolute foreign policies for them to get rich. Yes, and that's wrong Yeah, and they don't even Dude smirks. He smirks when you talk about it. Yeah, like he smirks like it's a fucking joke Bro, people are here. Listen man. We're here in the Midwest man. Most of these people are here just hardworking regular Americans that are common sense that They just don't want to be fucked with man, you know and These guys are laughing at us like that's how America feels and dude if you want a political consultant I'll give you some political consultation. Here's the reality with you, okay? You say all the right shit and it's great like and we are dude I'm over my head and I'm like fuck yeah, this is right But there's the American people and you're noticing this on the internet The American people have a problem trusting anybody right now because they've been so violated And so they think everybody including me they you know We we can't tell like is this person affiliated or is this person a plant or is this another zulinsky puppet and it's the right That's gonna be your biggest it's the truth over. I know totally I mean because we could we have a government and people have run for government Yeah, people in power that have systematically lied. Yeah, and so if you look like the others How do I know that you're real and yeah, it's the reality of where we are so people should be skeptical I would say believe nothing that anybody feeds you But you're gonna have to make a choice about what your best chances of moving a country forward And that's unfortunately the best we're gonna get right now People are here right now. They're here on this on this Obama line from the debate. Oh, yeah, well They're saying they're saying that you're the Republican Obama. You know what I actually There are elements of that. Yeah, that I'm actually leaning into yeah, because you want to know what Obama's really good at He's filling that void. So what he did he he leaned into his race He leaned his identity and says okay now it's about race and gender and sexuality and climate When we conservatives what have we been doing and I don't even use that word that much we in the pro-American movement What have we been doing? I don't I don't see you as a conservative. I mean, I see you as a common sense dude I'm pro-American as well. That's what I really yeah, and so we in our pro-American movement What have we been doing though? Myself included I'm not criticizing other people take a look at my three books. What have I been doing? I've been criticizing that vision right and I realized that's not good enough. Yeah, that's not gonna fix the country We have to actually play that game by offering a better vision of our own So if they're giving us race gender sexuality and climate I think we would do better to talk more about the value of the individual the family the nation and God I think individual family nation God beats race gender sexuality and climate and so far in the Republican party We have a bunch of partisan hacks that recite slogans their hand it out in a binder Criticizing what do they teach us even for the debate? What are the debate? Standard debate wisdom and preparation is You look at the super pack of leak of you know the which one was it was the desanis camp that had their super pack of leak Their memo criticize Biden at least three to five times and that's the traditional advice that all the candidates will get The way I look at it is first of all that's super robotic, but second of all You're missing the point if you're criticizing Biden. He's a puppet. Yeah, Zelensky's a puppet Biden's a puppet We have to actually have a vision of our own and the left is actually good at this the left will give you a vision They will it's the wrong vision, but they'll give you a vision and the alternative side the Republican party so pathetic that it has not for years offered an affirmative vision now Trump actually brought a new at least Character to the Republican party and that's good. He's still he's still Fails a little bit, but we got to pay. We actually stand for what are we running to and so in a certain sense Yes, I think we need that To actually have an alternative vision that dilutes the other sides poison to irrelevance and people say oh are you just a lot eloquent talking? No, I don't think anybody good. I want to use the gifts. I have been given to stand for an actual vision that contributes to this country I don't think anybody's I don't think that's what people are afraid of I think people love your charisma I think people think it's a may I think it's amazing. Cool. Yeah, we all have our gifts. I'll use them. Yeah, absolutely dude It's required in business like it makes perfect sense definitely required in politics. Yeah, yeah, the I think where they're afraid of is they think like okay This guy reminds me of Obama and when Obama got elected and you probably remember this as well like I didn't really care for him But I was hopeful he inspired me to think man. All right. I didn't vote for this guy, but Man he could do this and it could work and it could be awesome. Hope he does get this yes And and I think what people are afraid of I didn't feel that way I actually sat it out I voted libertarian 2004. Yeah, I sat it out no eight because both him and McCain I said This happened. Yeah, well, that's a I don't I think that's valid. Yeah, they both said that's the way I thought about it Yeah, but I did vote for McCain because I did what a lot of people did this last time and voted against the guy um Not for the guy right and you know I didn't know as much then but What I think they're afraid of is I think they're afraid of the get behind you because when Obama went in He didn't do any of the shit that he said he was gonna do he did all the opposite shit Yeah, I think that's what I think that's a pain point for people right now. I think it's cruising Yeah, yeah, the skepticism is like there's no track record, you know I'm saying so it's like how do we trust this guy who came you know an optics out of nowhere. Yep, right? How do we how can we trust that this person the most Tmituous time that we've been in as a country right politically yep historically How do we trust that person to just come in that we don't know with no proven track record? How do we trust that? Yeah, so look I think that Here's what I'll say the people who do have track records that's not the track record you want shitty right I mean Mike Pence said it on the stage. We don't have time for a rookie. We don't want someone too young What are they called me I think you killed himself with that one comment? I think so yeah, but but but I'm saying that's that's But that's from the Mike Pence view but even from from our people point of view to say okay, but still you're how do you know you're not just selling me Hope and dream are you actually gonna hold the line when you get into office Look, it's not my job to persuade you okay my job is I'm just gonna tell you who I am and what I stand for you should be skeptical I can tell you guys if you guys don't want that then then then go with somebody else and find better, but here's what I will say about this though is Look at the heat I'm taking now already Okay, it is obvious to anyone who's watching that I have like this to chalk no one there could be tens of millions of dollars of backing coming into super PACs that are for me I mean many ways What many in that establishment would dream for right a guy with the business background a guy who has come up through elite educated institutions And I know many of these people they're ready to support me and then they hear the things that I'm actually saying and they say oh We can't quite get there. So like does that make sense in the sense for me to sort of say I have all that teed up Let's say this is about my power dominion and control Okay, how do I get to the closest seat of power that I possibly can by playing some political snakes and ladders Well, first of all think look at the stuff they're hitting me on now you didn't there were many years I didn't vote in my 20s well. I wasn't plotting to be president my whole life turns out Okay, if I was now plotting to do it what would I be doing all the people the hedge fund kings of New York City many of whom You know people who I overlapped with in my prior life and otherwise Whose support would be really meaningful for me to be buying ads in Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada where I don't have ads on TV Because we're being smart and capital efficient But every other campaign with their super PAC puppets are flooding the airwaves This would be a lot easier for me to play that game. I'm not And so I think that should at least cause you to think twice you can listen to the things that I'm saying from the truth about Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9-11 All the way through Jeffrey Epstein's client list to the Nashville shooter manifesto I'm talking about the things you're not supposed to talk about that's right And do you think that's actually helping me right now because you could look at I mean in some sense with the people I hope it is I think it is but in the in the money raising game or all the game About Obama or the or the managerial class that's not how that game is actually played. So all I would say is actually be skeptical Absolutely, and I'm leaving it I've got two sons once three and a half years old once a year old We have reached the apex of living a great life We fly we we don't have we're not gonna go to commercial airport for the rest of our life if we don't want to unless this is to train our kids With the right values, which we probably will but we can have a beach house so we can have our Ohio house and live a good life And I like writing books I've go on TV plenty if I want to for suppose I want to be famous and that's the objective many ways to do that I'm just addressing some of the things I've heard it doesn't make sense To put yourself through this go through the sacrifices we are take the arrows make this job harder by speaking the truth about the hardest topics Turning down tens of millions of dollars that otherwise could be in the coffers if this was about any game other than Reviving truth in this country And you know what I've said this in the beginning. I'll say it again I would rather speak truth at every step and lose this election. I'm totally at peace with that Then to win by playing some carefully scripted path to winning And I truly don't know which is gonna be the winning strategy. I really don't It's an interesting experiment for me actually at the start of this campaign I'm curious how the world works how this country works. We're gonna find out Okay, if I'm unrestrained And speaking my mind at every step and totally comfortable That that may not lead to winning this election If everybody in this country knows who I am and what I stand for and they don't want to go with me They want to go with the other guy whoever that is I am totally cool with that But all I would say is We have the choices you do you can't be sure about anybody because as much as we're going shown up on the ground And I win New Hampshire meeting thousands of people I'm not gonna meet the 300 million people across this country You didn't prescript these questions with me. I'm doing these forums more than I am just standard cable television But at the end of the day people are gonna have to make a judgment. Yeah, all right and if you trust me I think you may trust 80% of what I say probably go with me if not I'm not gonna change your mind. No, I think you're making that's up to you I you know, we talk about on the show, you know, they attack who they don't want And yeah, I mean you've definitely been getting it. You know, look at this last week. That's a big indicator I think you're making some really fair points about that And I also think that And I'm just gonna say this because this is real. I'm you know Like I don't I'm good with people. I don't get that vibe from you Like I don't get it in person like I don't get this vibe of like I kind of get the vibe of how I feel about it where it's like Yeah, dude, somebody's got to do this since a passion or just yeah, and that's I got that vibe I mean 30 seconds in the meeting. I don't relish the idea being present. That's the other thing is like you know now I mean, what do you want to do that? I mean honestly when we started this campaign we were Landed in my heart my heart was in it To win, but now it's it's real right we're on a trajectory the same trajectory Trump was Honestly, I was talking to my wife two nights ago, and it's like I think this is gonna happen Neither of us is like looking forward to it But by the time we get out in January 2033 our older son he won't even mean high school yet I think we will feel good about what we did for this country And I think the way I'm looking at this as well. This is one of the mistakes the Trump made It's one of the mistakes that most presidents make they actually do promise hopes and dreams that they think they're gonna fulfill But it requires Congress repeal and replace Obamacare you might remember that one. Well, I think it would have been nice if it happened But it didn't because it requires so nothing that I'm promising requires 535 people in Congress to line up and agree with me because I can't make that promise But if you look at the promises I am making Right that we're gonna have a 75% headcount reduction in the federal bureaucracy that the president can do that Fucking huge dude and the president can do that. I don't need Congress to do that So every shutdown the Department of Education shut down the F-Six. Yeah, the president The president can so I didn't know that yeah, so the president has the power to make the government smaller Yes, and that's the executive branch of government smaller and that's the president runs the executive and that's something that you're committed to That's I'm deeply committed to in fact that's the number one thing I'm going into do. Yeah, there's two things I know I can do okay Shut down the most of the executive branch of the government that automatically stimulates the economy And the second isn't even through policy, but it's through the way you lead Revive national pride in this guy. Yep. I those two things without asking anybody else for permission That much I know I can get done now there'll be some legal Scholars who would tell you and you know the people who advise Trump and otherwise owner You can't do that that requires congressional permission and if you guys want to go into details I can go into details that say no, no And this where Trump got duped right they told him you can't fire federal employees because they have these So-called civil service protections right special protections that say if you're a federal employee you can't be fired you got to read the law It doesn't apply to mass layoffs Right the whole point is if you work for I don't know the EPA Yeah, you can't see them out. Yeah, I can't see you disagree with me But you're some environmental monitor that I can't fire you fine You could disagree or not with the policy. That's what the law says if I'm saying that are not all y'all are gone Because we're cleaning house and this stimulates the economy And that's actually one of the justifications in the law if it stimulates the economy or eliminates redundant agencies You can shut down agencies you can fire large numbers of people And that's absolutely what I'm bringing to Washington DC And so it does take a pretty rare combination of somebody coming in from the outside with complete disregard and disrespect For that professional political class and I didn't realize it But apparently that disdain came across on the debate stage last week I didn't mean it that way, but I just do have a natural disdain for the professional managerial I think that only class But but has but you have to also know what you're talking about when it comes to the law or else you're gonna be duped By those same people who are your advisers that tell you all the reasons you can't do it So then we do it and I've also studied the current Supreme Court Which I give Trump a ton of credit for one of the most valuable things he did and it's important They agree with me six to three on this So then we go in there and get that done by the time I'm leaving in January 2033 The Supreme Court's already said no, no, this guy's right six to three The next guy who takes over after me iron. I will be I will relish in handing over the keys to whoever that person is Doesn't have his hands tied In the same way that my hands are tied nominally on day one And so that's how I look at it. This is eight years you go in parts of it Are gonna feel like a sharp poke in the eye. I'm sure it's nice to ride around on Air Force one, but it's Less of an upgrade for me than it is for many people from for than it was for Barack Obama Get into that position real community organizer. That's not why I'm in this I'm in this because I think that I didn't serve this country actually I think there's a lot of ways to serve a country. You don't need to follow the capitalist But I didn't I didn't serve the country in a civic sense I did it as a capitalist and this is gonna be my way of doing it And I know do a lot of people that and maybe in some measure it is just ridiculous to say Yeah, I'm gonna do my national servicing on to it by being US president But the honest truth is we all have to look ourselves in the mirror And ask ourselves How am I gonna use the gifts that God has given me that God has given you that God has given you to make your maximal contribution And I don't think being the president's the most important job in the country. I really don't He has he has an important role to play But I'm not sure if it's more important to be a president or a pastor right now In fact, you could make a argument that A pastor is gonna fill that vacuum With something far more meaningful than a US president ever can It's not my job to be a pastor, but I will I will fill it with the vacuum of national identity That's of them the president can do And that's something I'm confident I can I think you're hitting on a super important part Of the puzzle here What you just said about in not being important. This is no different than us running our companies Yes, like people will say to you. Oh, you're the CEO or you're the chairman or you're this and it's so such a big deal And it's like no, it's just a part of the it's just a part of The requirements to do the mission totally and the president is just like that That's how I look at it as well. I see it the same way you're seeing it And I think that actually if we're being honest about what's going to fix the country It isn't going to be a president It's going to be individuals in their communities Deciding that they want to live a higher standard of life meaning culturally And then spreading that to their neighbors to the left to the right to their sons and daughters to their cousins And when people lift themselves up other people start to look at them and they say What's what's he doing? What do you what do you do in Vivek you look great you've been taking care of yourself You know you've been working hard. I see your family. They're great How do you do it and then that spreads totally and that's what we're talking about here work I feel like we have been lulled asleep as a culture To believe that we are dependent on somebody 2000 miles away to make the decisions for us when in reality the decisions They make have very little effect on our lives That's right and our community and what you're talking about American culture American pride American identity American values these things have to come from you guys listening They don't come from Vivek they don't come from Trump. They don't come from anybody else. They don't come from Andy They don't come from anybody. They come from you living it and I agree with that statement. I that's a very either that's the best thing you said so far honestly in the It's it's it's a responsibility that comes with Part of the role of being the CEO then it's not that it's the most important position But part of the position in a company or part of the position in being the CEO of the executive branch and leaving this country Is here's the standard I want you all to hold me to do you have kids by the way? No, you know, okay You guys are two kids I've got two sons as well I will be able to have kids so it's like it's not that we didn't want to just did never happen for us Okay, well, but I have a young and I have an extreme life ahead. I have an extreme Sense of responsibility to our younger generation perfect And then and you know what life is long and there's many ways to yeah You're over 100 of them in here to see how that exact if you are the end of this microphone too Sorry, I'm looking pretty you know, they look like they're they're doing what fine under your tutelage here They're dead and leave you start I want you to be able to look at each of those people out there those young people on the basketball court and the gym You to look at your two kids. I want to look at my two sons and tell them in good conscience That whoever that is in the White House. I want you to grow up and be like him. Mm-hmm. That's a high standard. Yes But I think that that's half the that's half the job of the greatest president is being lead and live your life in a way that allows young people to say okay I want to grow up and be like him or a parent to want to tell their kids That same thing It's the revival of a kind of national character That we missed I think we have missed for a really long time. I think that's half the job Half the job is getting done with the US president can get done and if we're lucky And use that momentum that actually puts us in a stronger position to get a few laws passed to Or better yet a few laws repealed and then call that a day That's eight years work. Keep us out of war. Grow the economy drop the mic next guy take over. Yeah, that's it That exactly that's that's what the president sees and then there's there's a job for everybody else to play From CEO to pastor to parent to a school board member There's a job for everybody else to play too And I do think we fall into this trap. I think the right especially does actually But I think all of us do in some way is Expecting that there's going to be some Political Messiah coming from on high to say otherwise done work that way. Yeah, it's not Andy from the show It's not me from the White House. No, if we're gonna be saved It is gonna be because we save ourselves. So I'm not letting you off the hook that easily I'm gonna do my part as the US president, but it's like you know back to that mentality Well, are you gonna sell me this hope and dream and how do I know you're gonna do that for me? I'm not I'm gonna do what I'm telling you I'm gonna do which is my part But if we want to be saved you better do your part to save yourself too. It's gonna require all of us To actually I want to call a great uprising in this country, but you have to play your part to revolution That's what that's what that's what we're talking right. We're not talking about cultural counter revolution is really I mean shit that's if we're gonna be in real about it. That's what we're dealing with um But that's that cannot be implemented by anybody else but the individual Yep, and that's what people are failing and I don't know what that is. I don't know what that savior syndrome thing is that's going on um, I think it's really a lot of it I think a lot of it in the tech a lot of the air right? Dude, I think a lot of it came from I think a lot of it comes from Trump being so different than most of the other politicians that have been around for a long long time That people have like attached their identity to this man uh and by the way um I Voted for Trump both times and I actually like Trump. He's a great president. That's it on the stage I wrinkled a lot of people when I said that and it's what it is as it is the greatest president of the 21st century people Like what did he just say? Let's just go through the list George Bush. You can't argue with what he brought Obama let's go by and yes, he was the best president of the We have to take all of the shit, but still people don't like about him off the table and because it's all surface level bullshit All right The guy got more shit done than anybody else That is it and that's how we should be judging people if you and I are running a company and and this is my vice president over here And I got this guy over here that wants to be vice president and this guy's tweeting some weird shit But he does a better job. Guess who's getting the job the guy that tweets the weird shit Okay, that's what it is and This savior complex comes from everybody attaching their identity to him Because he's been so different than everybody else thinking that there's nobody else like him When in reality if there was nobody else like him he wouldn't draw A hundred thousand people to his freaking rallies for 30 days in a row prior to the election Which by the way was great optics and smart strategy, but the point is I agree with you. Yeah I think we got to move we got to graduate from that right? We got to graduate from the Messiah complex And I think it takes somebody who Because we're human beings too. Yeah, right. I mean Let's let's be honest. I mean there'll be times where if I'm in room for a thousand people We'll have him captive And people standing up cheer and chanting at the end of it. It can get to your head. Yeah. Oh, yeah But you but you but so then people but then people there want a Messiah And so then you sort of do it yourself into thinking well, I am one And that's I think where where it goes wrong even with the best of what we've had right in the 21st century. I think that's where we fell short back to that question What is it inside our heart that makes us want to bend the knee we're gonna bend the knee to something Unless you fill it with the real thing and so I'm a vehicle for delivering a vision of national identity It's not about me. What it means to be an American Maga which I in some sense consider myself part of America first. I definitely consider myself part of That is bigger than one man. Yeah, doesn't belong to all of us. It doesn't belong to me It belongs to all of us right and that's the mentality of Leadership to take our America first to agenda to the next level That's what I think it's gonna take I like the America first better than maga a lot because it just means more What do you mean? We put America first if we're being real America hasn't always been great to everybody So when you say make America great again certain classes of people say what the fuck does that mean? You know, but if you say America first put America first and that means all Americans first I agree South side of Chicago to Kensington to Maui Put them first over some Ukrainian government employees and people don't really know this they say military equipment The media doesn't really make this clear. We are literally spending Our taxpayer dollars the way more taxpayer dollars going into the government that should Are literally paying the salaries of Ukrainian government officials right now. So the Ukrainian government's pay Right the HR department in Ukraine's government is literally printing money coming They're focusing the checks person is an American yeah, there's folks person is an American Like it's a transgender American like dude to do to check. Yeah, well No, that's what the dude listen. We got a game to play guys I love to talk with y'all day, but we got to play this game. Okay. All right. We the game. We got something for you So tell us the game DJ like listen like we like to have a good time on the show First of all, there's a great conversation love the intro. Oh dude. I could go on for we could go on for two others But we I mean, that's what this game hopefully is gonna give us the opportunity to do so today guys We're gonna be playing America is in Jeopardy It's a jet is a jet car. I like you know part listen copyright issues I went to public high school. I mean there's a couple of reasons We do need education reform. Yeah, education reform Is it your favorite though? I like that. So we're off like some jeopardy. I just didn't want to get sued honestly That's my thing. Oh, but yeah, so we're all good into this. So uh, so I was just gonna work So yeah, so we're we'll go through our categories, right? And then you know, you guys can pick a category pick your dollar amount We'll go through it and we get to talk a little bit about those issues. So Let's go through our categories shall we now who gets the first pick? I think we'll get the guests the first thing I think the guest gets the first one for sure. Okay, let's go through the categories. Let's see what we got We got COVID-19 the greatest reset See what I did there. I like it. Yeah I mean, I like that the cleverness of it. I don't like the actual substance All of my say they're gonna go viral. He said he loved COVID Like greatest reset. I don't like the great reason it's the greatest reset We got bi dynamics We got the deep deep state Emedy Gracie on Prime in America and then our last category Russia Ameri-crain war All right So those are our categories guys if you guys are watching on YouTube make she like Subscribe and comment play along with us. Let us know in the comments how you guys are doing on these uh on these categories But uh, so what they been said the fake Well, let's pick your first category. Let's go with the deep deep state for 200 deep deep state for 200 This iNGO is the international organization for public private corporation and engages the foremost political business Cultural and other leaders of society to shape global regional and industry in industry agendas So i'm supposed to name what the what the organization what what is Yeah, what is the world economic forum? Yes So let's talk what what's your do you have any uh like what what should take on the on the w. Yeah Well, let's let's let's put this shit to rest first of all I mean, I'm convinced that it is never gonna be put to rest on i'm a piece with that yeah Because because people should be skeptical So i have been probably i'm sorry before i already know the the whole you know Maybe you was a double leader that's bullshit Yeah, I mean, they actually did that to grit and still they did it to mosque We're back So the people who so i i i don't think it was innocent but i don't but i don't know for sure They named me. I was the biggest critic look at the look at the person who's been exposing their ESG agenda over the last four or five years I don't like to pat myself on the back, but there's probably nobody in the united states of america who has exposed their poison More than me over the last four years maybe save for Glenn back okay The real another guy Yeah, what was it guys? That randy can sell a guy. He's got a podcast. I forgot what it's called He's that that's that that's a good things about this by this So The reality is though it's the old world that's what this is about the old world monster was that We the people cannot be trusted to sort out our differences on climate change or racial injustice They think they're agenda. This is what you have to understand to get it if you really want to get it Like there's the superficial version that it's these guys are evil they want to destroy us. They're coming after us Etc But if you really want to get it the most frightening part of all Is that they actually think they're doing it for your good. Oh, yeah, they believe they're doing it They're good. Yes, they believe they care about you so much that they have to Do what's right for you because you can't be trusted to do it yourself on existential questions like systemic racism or climate change which is really their favorite or two anger. It's a no The old worldview because the kings and the old palaces of old rolling and they said we love our subjects I love my subjects like my children. They just my children can't be trusted to vote And actually decide how they're gonna sort out their differences. That's a funny idea if you think about your subjects as your children Well, the United States of American 1776 said hell no to that vision That's exactly how we do it on this side of 1776 and every so often that old world monster starts to rear It's head again, and that's what the modern world economic forum is mountain tops of Davos are the palace halls in old world England that's what it's about so how what do we do with them So I think that mostly what the United States has to do is make sure that we are first building the walls to protect our own sovereignty Look at those multilateral institutions I mean the WHO sure that's an easy one don't fund an institution that's fundamentally hostile to our sovereignty I think we have to take a long hard look at our continued involvement in the UN itself. Oh, dude We got to be gone out of all of the I mean the UN why on earth are we funding an institution where The human rights council the staff to buy like the rights of by the likes of like Venezuela and North Korea on the UN This is madness And so I think the US needs to get itself out of these multilateral institutions that are hostile to US interests Do we need to do with other countries certain other countries sure we'll do it bilaterally But get out of this multilateral globalist view that we're one nation amongst co-equals no We're the greatest nation on earth we're going to stand up for our interests And that's good for the rest of the world you want to know why? Because when the US is strong at home That's the last best hope that any other free nation has correct that it can aspire to That's what we need to stand up for I love this I agree. I love it. Yeah, so defund In straw defund yes, and they will and they will crumble NATO as well. We're paying NATO is it I mean NATO's moment these things should have been tasked with our aligned here, right? Yeah, I mean the moment as long as it was To deter the USSR. Yeah, and the news flash that I delivered to some of my fellow candidates on stage last week was The USSR doesn't exist anymore It fell back in 1990 And now NATO is taking close taking us closer to nuclear war with Russia when it's supposed purpose was to deter nuclear war with the USSR Time to fold up and move on bro for sure. It's interesting that these people continue to pretend like We're dealing with 1980s Russia like that's right. It's been over for 30 years man Yeah, those are years and and the reality is if you're still reciting slogans you memorized in 1980 you're not thinking Yeah, that's correct. You're not growing You're not evolving and what there's this guy Kenan he he was probably the leading Architect of our Cold War deterrence strategy. So even the Neocons are gonna have to respect this guy in the late 90s Before he died he said that NATO expansionism Was our worst policy error in the post Cold War era and he was right about that And yet nobody seems to want to admit it today because they're still addicted to their muscle memory from four years ago So anyway, I love it. Yeah, well, let's let's uh, let's keep this going The vancus two hundred dollars richer. Yeah, yeah I'm gonna go for four hundred man. That's right. Cool. Well, we got oh, it's me right um Oh I think I'm gonna take the COVID-19 the greatest reset and I'm just gonna go hard and go for the thousand go for a thousand Yeah, all right here we go 98.2% What is the survival rate of COVID-19? Yeah, that's it. Oh, wow Actually higher than that, but maybe they're using third world stats in that too. I think the American survival is higher This is the stat of people that actually get COVID um With no corribities that I believe that's what that is. They're throwing all kinds of stats around the yeah part No, I think actually if you include that that that survival rate. I think is actually even higher It just came out with something this week right? I mean, it just came out with something saying that I was actually like less than you know 0.01% of people died of COVID But the problem was like I'm like listen like this is with including every comorbidity This is everything but the thing is like even that stat the reason you know, we didn't put in the show We didn't talk about on the last episode either, but it's like That was one week. We're looking at one like one seven day period Yeah, the last like to me. That's just not enough weight. Yeah, you know, so I mean I get we try to be fair It's really good. That's good. That's good. Yeah, like he's caught caught like it is good job, man So you're richer than I am now, so I gotta go for some arms All right, what we got let's go for uh Russia Ameri crane war for 800 so I can go for the tie here. All right On 26 September 2022 a series of clan desktan bombings and subsequent underwater gas leaks occurred on these Natural gas pipelines that was a very kind to the US statement of that description the Nord Stream 1 and 2 Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Let's just be let's just call the fact the fact we did it. We did it Yeah, we did it We did it. Yeah, yeah, and I think it was a mistake. Yeah, I think we should be focusing more I think you think it was a mistake that we did it or you think it was I think it was a mistake that we did it I don't like okay. Yeah, I think it was a mistake that we did we absolutely planned it It was intentional. It was it was intentional I think that there's very little doubt about the fact that the US and some combination of the US and Ukraine Did that yeah, I think we need to be going in the other direction where we need to pull this is this is what's driving Russia further into China's arms right because Russia's not able to be integrated into the economic infrastructure of the West They're gonna go to somebody else's infrastructure. That's China So we do Well, I mean, I if you want to go to World War III. It's a great plan to get there If we have a compromised president who's calling plays like this and and we do have a compromised present And so then that's pushing Russia put yourself in China So we're double wins for a second right like just imagine the tables are turned and forgets out Putin because that's a bad word that makes people stop being able to think straight Sort of like Trump actually just forget the label say say you're in his seat Okay Now you see the US president so you're you're fighting a war against somebody and the US president's Arming to the teeth your enemy and then you find out that that enemy has been funding the family particularly the unqualified son that couldn't get a job at McDonald's at a fast food chain or anything else. I mean that's generous. I mean McDonald you couldn't get a good job here in the United States Somehow finding one on the board of barisma Ukrainian energy company that's affiliated with the government That pays millions of dollars. Just make sense like they literally just bribed him to help them That's what that's what you might say But the reality is now the US is going in the opposite direction where Russia has to turn to China Where we should be doing the opposite do a deal with Russia that says we will reopen economic relations with Russia We will freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine We will make a hard commitment that NATO which we told you James Baker told Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not expand one inch not one inch was his word past Germany Well, we will stand by that commitment at least now even though we haven't so far We'll keep it now to say that Ukraine will not be admitted to NATO But in return, you got to get yourself out of the Chinese Getting out of that Russia China partnership. Yeah, that would make sense that would make a lot of sense That would make sense like it would make a lot of sense and yet we're doing the exact opposite Yeah, and how does that make sense what makes sense because somebody getting rich off of it. That's correct The Biden family's getting rich. They've sold off our foreign policy. It's interesting how people keep saying Oh, that doesn't make sense. Well, if you think about it just a little bit differently. It makes perfect sense. It does Yeah, love it. All right, you're up We're tied right now a thousand that's what we're trying to do. Yeah. All right Let's go for I want to I want to stay on this COVID stuff because it's starting to get hot again. Let's go for COVID for 800 This type of medical research genetically altars and organism in a way that may enhance the biological functions of gene products Oh, what is gain of function research? That's it So this is that's sort of that's sort of aligned with with what You've been into right business like biotech and things like that. Yeah, I mean we weren't like creating viruses that create pandemics in the world I didn't be like that I know this world you would have got this one Yeah, and you know we banned it in the United States and yet they still did it in China Dude and then it comes back and rogue government agents Fauci on down funded it There's actually a good lesson to learn on AI by the way So you think you banned something in the United States if it happens in China It's still going to come back right so there's an interesting interesting parallel. There is a hard discussion to have about AI Yeah, a very difficult one and it's It's a hard problem to solve but Let's talk about this COVID just for a second because I want to get your take on this chair now Unruly it's my opinion liable. It's my opinion that what has happened You know when we consider the big picture of COVID And we look at all the things that we know now We look at there's been gain of function research. We we look at that, you know They purposefully Withheld effective therapeutics from being accepted or talked about or you know when they have Joe Rogan talking about ivermectin They're blasting him through the media They're not allowing people they're putting people in jail like america's front line doctors for talking about hydroxocloric win Yep, and ivermectin my best friend had to watch his father die over a zoom call all right So I feel very passionately about what's happened here and when I look at what's happened here and then the transfer of wealth That was happened that was Gone along with it basically the suppression of the middle class into More of a poverty class. Yep I'm this is crimes against humanity All right, I think so that's how I look at it and I think this is this is stuff has to be accountability very very strong accountability And I heard you say on a show Where you talked about putting down the weapons and not holding you know not not continuing to slit each other's threats if it's politicized. Okay, so Do and listen you tell me if you disagree But I think examples need to be made. I think that people should be held accountable in such a way that for 100 200 300 years people understand we do not do this to people We do not intentionally infect people with a virus. We do not withheld or withhold their ability to treat the virus Yeah, we do not Transfer and shut down businesses from the middle class mom and pop to the biggest companies in the world And I believe that everybody associated with this From the media the key people now the media Fauci All these people who who went along at the decision makers. Yep deserve to be held accountable and made examples of What's your opinion on that? So I phrase it slightly differently. Yeah, I would I would let's take the head on a stake approach Because I never want to be them right I just say one standard of the rule of law for everybody No special exemptions and what we're seeing right now is there are special exemptions If anybody else did what Anthony Fauci did literally intentionally violate a federal law That then actually causes millions of Americans to die. Yes as a consequence of that decision They would be held accountable under the law So I think it's simpler which is just apply one standard of the rule of law to everybody Period, that's it And if you're convicted in a court of law pursuing to that standard of law You will be punished to the proper full extent of that law So you're just saying follow the law follow the law that's simple And so I want to the thing I want to us to caution against is What are they doing against Trump right now, right? It's sort of the old style. No, I can't say you find the man I'll find the offense you don't want the panel in the swing back the other way So pendulum thing it's it's just like I never I will never lead a justice department that says Find the man then find the offense no But if we find an offense then we're going to hold the man or the woman accountable for it And that's what we need in this country so the rule of law and that means that absolutely Anthony Fauci I believe on the facts we currently have is criminally liable Yeah I'm never going to be the other side and say that's preordained But it better be investigated go to a full court of law and he's convicted No way he's getting a pardon on that either he has to serve the time for what he did for this country But I stand for the rule of law and I want to make sure that we never become them. I get that I think we differ there You know, yeah, we do a little bit because I believe this is an I believe this is an exceptional extraordinary experience that we've all been through you've never been through this in your entire life Because they brought the law what's my point? Yeah, I know but what I'm but and I understand that yeah, but Millions of people yeah, so here's your comments of that though lost their Wives you know, yep, right and you and I both know what what how much did you pay to be where you are? I gave everything I've given everything and it When I think of what's happened I think of it no different than the accountability that needed to be had in number And a generation of kids who will never be the same so I think oh yeah, I mean I think first of all we should hold China accountable I mean there's an intentionality of this from China side too They intentionally argument that we did it well that there's there's there's Accountability for Fauci. Yeah, I think that this should be criminally investigated. I should Putin just submit a 2000 page documents in NATO saying that the mayor the United States did it out of Ukraine not out of Wuhan Is that right? Yeah, so interesting. That's in there somewhere Yeah, so we're we don't know yet who did it so but the realities get to the bottom of it Hold them accountable apply the law. Yeah, that's what I don't want to make up the law apply the law We have laws that in this country that reckless government officials Intentionally disregarded now you have China so you believe in accountability. I believe in accountability Full accountability. I believe under the law heads on stakes Riding on the White House lawn for a thousand fucking years For people to see and know that we do not do this to people and for me being that mean in prison is good enough Okay, that's what I would say that's cool. Yeah, all right. I if that happens I'm not gonna be mad about it. Yeah, there we go. We'll say that. Yeah. Yeah, let's keep going all right No, oh, yeah, my turn. Okay, got it. Let's do the commentaries are getting narrative. I mean that's a lot. Yeah, yeah, let's do Wish ones have we didn't let's do bi dynamics for what did you just do 800? Yeah, let's do bi dynamics for 800 This quickly erodes the real value of local currency as the prices of all goods Increase causing people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies So it could be a couple of different things you could say here you could say inflation because definitely is Something that erodes the real value of local currency. Let's go with inflation inflation. Yeah Andy want to try Three seconds reading it. I mean inflation does do that, but yeah, I would say was inflation as well Okay, well the answer we were looking for was hyper-inflation Oh Yeah, listen, come on hey All right, I mean inflation would be a correct answer, but hyperinflation is also correct. Yeah, I mean yeah, yeah, you know It's a small difference. Are you small dip he's all right? Let's get back to it. Let's try you take another shot. Yeah, sure. Let's do let's do What should we say crime in America for 800? Okay crime in America 800 This horrendous violent crime happens when an attacker kills or injures multiple individuals simultaneously while using a firearm Mass shooting of course absolutely Let's talk about this a little bit because we've been seeing upticks in this in this country um Where we got on it I think we got a mental health epidemic in this country. I mean, I think we know how to deal with this We have a we have a giant wave of violent crime in this country. Let's just confront that right now We know how to address it More cops on the streets not and myself the streets. I mean like literally walking the streets Able to do their jobs without looking over their shoulders for fear of getting sued for doing their jobs And the second thing is bring back mental health institutions Because over the same period that we've seen the shuttering of mental health institutions We have seen a direct rise in violent crime Now I'm not in favor of mental health institutions that drug people up Do you love me Sarah Quillen and Zolaft and I don't want the one who flew over the cook who's nest kind of stuff here But temporary involuntarily involuntary commitments for psychiatrically ill people who pose a danger to their communities Bringing that back with by the way faith-based approaches that restore purpose do this in a way that does not rely on the pharmaceutical industrial complex We know how to get this done Do we have the forward to do it? Those are politically incorrect things cops walk in the street ensuring law and order Making sure that they can't be sued for just simply doing their job that easily And bringing back mental health institutions including faith-based approaches including some measure Of involuntary commitment for psychiatrically ill people who pose a physical danger to their communities That's how we address the problem. We know how to do it We've done it before we've done it before yeah questions. Do we have the spine actually? I do yeah, that's what it's gonna take here's another problem though the sorrows funded prosecutors yep of they're not prosecuting bro We have one here. Yeah, we did right here. Yeah really and they they do not so they've demoralized the police and all of these cities Because they will not prosecute crime at all and and dude this is another rub for you You know, I see people talk about the sorrows scholarship that you that you accepted Let's talk about that for a second. Yeah, what Explain explain that because yeah, sure sorrows Is a disaster yes, he's a criminal So so George's Rosen about 2016 that's when his coincide with the Trump administration. It's not a coincidence Started funding you soft on crime prosecutors and I've been a big critic of it and we got to put it to an end To be clear George sorrows has actually been and his investment partners have been funding people on both sides of the political There's I'm not gonna you know call out individuals here, but there's another individual in this presidential campaign Who this June hosted a fundraiser hosted by George sorrows's investment partners another candidate has received a $160 million dollar alone Directly from George sorrows So it makes me laugh when those people's opposition research operations say that I got a sorrows scholarship Let's just set one thing straight Nothing to do with George sorrows. I have zero time with George sorrows other than being a critic of his George sorrows has a relative Paul sorrows who made his money independently who is long dead Who back in 2010 was one of the funders of a generic scholarship that at the age of 24 I applied for in one I helped me pay for law school 50,000 bucks or whatever it was for two semesters of law school Hundreds of kids went it you're 20 in your 20s and back in 2010 Long before even the prosecutor wave that we're talking about here some guy with the same last name Sorrows who's a relative of this other guy George sorrows. Yes, it was one of the funders of a generic scholarship that I want And I would have had to at the age of 24 go into law school Like the politics of that. It's just like not going through my head. There's a merit-based scholarship It allows you to in part pay for law school You would have had to be a fool. I would have had to be an idiot not to apply for and win that scholarship And honestly anybody who would have done that probably has no business doing trade deals from the White House on behalf of the country But the fact of the matter is you know what would a guy like me saying the things that I am saying now be able to You know win something like that now now, but who cares? I've made it. I understand how to get ahead in this country Didn't have any strings attached if it did nobody's gonna put a muzzle on me telling me what I can and can't say I think people are afraid of matter is you know, it's disaster. I think this goes back to the Obama The shit we talked about earlier. Yeah, I think people are afraid That You're going to get in there and then kind of change tune. You know what I'm saying? I think people people people are so For me to so I mean, I Well, they're so sensitive like hold on one second. They're so sensitive. But I get it. Yeah, they're so sensitive Because dude, we've all witnessed what these people have done totally and we're all and it's not going under the radar anymore Like people are now like okay anything world economic form. No, yes, that's correct. Soros. No, Alex Soros. No George Soros Rick's fucking Soros Soros. No, no Soros like like that's where people are at and so that's where people should be at Right now, so so I'm trying to so I think please I'm asking these questions is because I want to get my so Donald Trump shortly before running for office took a 160 million dollar loan from George Soros. Should that be disqualifying of Donald Trump my opinion on that? No Because he's a businessman. Well, no one does talk about that. No one does talk about it Just talk about facts. Let's talk about facts. Right right shortly before running In his adult life as a businessman takes a 160 million dollar loan Do I hold that against him? No, do I think the people should hold that against him? No because it's guided by what he's gonna do if that came with strings attached to say what you must do in government Different story, but I but we know it doesn't You know, Ron DeSantis even you know George Soros has been praising Ron DeSantis during this race saying he wants to do in this primary hosted a Investment partner of George Soros this June hosted a fundraiser for Ron DeSantis is that a problem I don't have all the answers to say whether that is or is not a problem I haven't been hitting him over it, but I don't have the facts to say that's a problem People should decide I've been very transparent about it. There is a generic scholarship funded by a relative of George Soros who is long dead in 2010, this is brother right? Yeah, it's a brother who made his money independently and so if you're 24 you're like oh, I'm by the way Did I know about George Soros's liberal agenda is back then? No In fact, when did George Soros start funding these soft on crime prosecutors? 2016 so in 24 at the age of 24 If you're 2010 Saying that hey, there's an opportunity for him in 50,000 bucks and actually I haven't told the story before literally Here's how I heard about it. There are a bunch of people in law school that first year one L. Fall talking about it They're like oh my god the deadlines Monday for the scholarship. I'm like oh, what's that? Like there's the scholarship you can win 50,000 bucks. I said oh, that's cool The deadline was on Monday. I heard about it on Friday. These people have been preparing for weeks Yeah, I said how long does it take to fill out they're like others this application I said I'll do it on that Sunday. They didn't turn it in Win the scholarship for 50,000 bucks at the age of 24. Yeah, you take it like that's the answer And so like I said people my job is to tell you who I am and what I stand for we have a country to save and so If that is really gonna hold you up like on that set of facts when we got it We have a serious job to do pick who's gonna lead this country next It probably would also have hold you up from picking Donald Trump for taking a hundred sixty million dollar loan Probably hold you up a broad santa but but but you have facts I've seen it but I was never able to verify it's interesting. Yeah, it's fact No one talks about that, but my point is have all the facts and then make a decision. Yeah, and that's a fair answer. Yeah Yeah, well, who's trying to just the truth? Hey look dude I'm gonna ask questions. You know you should man Everybody should and and I've been you know, I've probably answered this one You know 20 some of times, but that's okay because not everybody here's it every time We have a website. Yeah, that we just put up. It was a good suggestion I just think we're dealing with the fear so he said all right here's all here's all the and and people should ask the questions But read it for yourself decide for yourself Our trust and belief and repeatedly. Yeah, dude and we've been We we we see The people come on TV every day and fucking lie to us dude look at the The White House spokespeople the entire time Biden's been in office look at the media look at these fucking people These people go on TV and they fucking lie to our faces every single day and so people Like we're at the point now where everybody's like we're living in a true banana republic This is total lies. It's or well is 1984 and their trust for anything is just None yep, so and I appreciate the fact that you say so openly like they should be skeptical They should and he's just go through the list because I grew up in this right lied about sadi arabes involvement in 9-11 Yeah, lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq Lie about the 2008 financial crisis bail out justification lied about who killed Kennedy You just The Hanabah and laptop story the trump russia collusion hoax the origin of covid. Yeah, I mean you just keep going down Our money's being spent in Ukraine. So I get it. I mean my best advice is I know you get it Everybody be skeptical about me. We've got to the only way forward as a country But we've got to place our bets on how we're gonna do this and I think I know where I'm at Yeah, and even if I was in the shoes of somebody else looking at the outside in at me Would I be a little skeptical at first? I maybe I'd be skeptical of everybody But I think I'm the best bet we've got and that's why I'm in this race. I think you are say I think what you're saying For most people is exactly what they want to hear. I think that's super refreshing dude When I saw you raise your hand on on TV about the Ukraine thing or when I saw you say hey We shouldn't be giving money to other countries and then you have people saying oh well, you know Israel's our biggest ally we need Israel. No, we're America, dude. We are Americans. We are taking care of Americans We have bad American problems right now and until those are fixed We shouldn't be doing anything with anybody else like I don't know if anybody's noticed and probably not because 98% of Americans haven't ever traveled to Europe or anywhere else But when you go into the the cities of this country versus the cities of other countries Guess who the third world country is. It's not them. It's us go to Kensington In the middle of Philadelphia right. I've gone to India growing up We've seen I mean we just we didn't have toilets. We squat on the ground We get sick every time where we go like that's what that look like I have not seen a place worse and that was in the 90s. It's not even in day today I've been to Kensington two months ago. I haven't seen a third world nation as bad as Kensington in the middle of Today in the United States and so that's just that's just you know what When I raise my hand for sand that I would be Americans. These are Americans Well, I would pardon Trump or whether what I would do in Ukraine We I mean I've lost serious potential backing over it. Yeah, so you know think about think about that when you think about Whether I mean what I'm saying. Yeah, look dude. It's like over the context of you people say while you're just saying that to get Look, look losing serious money in terms of potential donations over this But you be the judge name that's the judge of who you want as your next president Do you want someone to say in the wrong things or somebody who's saying the right things someone saying the right things is your best darn back I think it's what the truth is sometimes people aren't gonna like the truth totally and that's reality You know, I could appreciate the candor very much That's what we're founded on is your turn. Yeah, Sandy sir. Is it my turn? Yeah, yeah, let's go with uh Let's go with deep deep state for a thousand deep deep state for a thousand This man allegedly ran an underground CIA operation that used black And pedophilia to influence and effect change who is Jeffrey Epstein What no, yes He fuckers Shake listen man. I'm a fucking winner. You can't do that shit to me Yeah, it's every up steam, man Yeah, I mean listen What do you really think the whole Epstein island thing like like I mean we can do 10 falls if we need to I don't know if they're necessary at this point, but like I don't think it's 10 fall anymore That's just real yeah enough stuff is out what what is your 10th union when take on the Epstein island situation So I think that there it's it's kind of what it looks like you think it's what it looks like which is that he was the dealer for a lot of men to Do what they could afford to pay for and It was just a quiet understanding that this is how the game works It's people on both sides of the political aisle people across the business world and They knew that if he was in prison and he had a chance to get out that that was a serious risk I mean if you think about like Bill Gates looks like he got divorced over it, right? I mean look what they're sweeping under the road for that Right, and so no, I mean they're not allegedly on that. I mean his wife has been very clear She said straight up that way his relationship with Epstein now she didn't say it was going to be islands or anything But she says Bill Gates is like bizarrely Elegant relationship to Jeffrey Epstein was part of what drove his divorce so this is like nobody in I mean not nobody but There are a lot of people and snared at the highest levels of business and politics and international governance In what is really just a Base human instinct that Jeffrey had dean was peddling to meet which was Sax now about the You know the underage elements of this or whatever. I mean I haven't Dived deep into the ugly sword of nature of this. I started watching the documentary I just couldn't take it and make me made me feel god awful and say just turn it off I'm gonna watch something else But it is what meets the eye now that guy dies It's interesting that he tells supposedly his brother Who comes out and says that They were describing him as suicidal, but in fact His brother's telling him that he's not suicidal. This is before he dies And then the guy turns up dead. Oh, and then the cameras are out the cameras are out. Yes Subway shooting the cameras are out at you vaulting actually think You know who I think did a pretty good segment on this which I thought was interesting and ask the right questions Because there's always like you can make up like a lot of Narratives, but I prefer to stay grounded to fact Tucker Carlson actually did a pretty good job of this. I want to say it was earlier this year before he You know before his TV show ended. Yeah, it was It was a pretty good evidence-based segment that pointed to the fact that the supposed investigation Never really investigated the possibility That it was somebody on the floor right somebody else a different person A potentially prisoner or guard on the same floor That did the deed right the investigation found that nobody came into the prison Okay, but then you create enough of a smoke screen that attracts the lightning rod You haven't just eliminated every possibility But you use that possibility to create a deflection It's kind of what they're doing with a hunter-buy and gun charges right the unlawful possession charges We're going after him Maybe he was a cocaine user and he didn't write that as an application for the firearm What do they know there's a bunch of public anger at this situation It's like lightning in the air needs a lightning rod Make that the lightning rod and then hopefully the real thing goes away Yeah, because nobody else is that the trick they use repeatedly So I think they use that trick here with the supposed investigation of whether somebody came in Through the front door say they said no, we have security footage around the perimeter and nobody came in around well That doesn't eliminate the possibility We do somebody inside because a lot of people inside And so to deduce from that that he killed himself is a big leap to ask people to believe and especially against the circumstances I just think that one of the things I've said is look when I'm US president we will release the client list I don't care who's on there Republican Democrat doesn't matter We've got to roll that log over every log that has been Festering with something underneath it roll the log over see what crawls out That is the only we're going to rebuild public trust in this country. Yeah, I believe see it My opinion on this Epstein stuff is and and I've I've talked to a listen. There's a lot of You've talked to some of these guys too Who have spent time in these agencies who understand what Epstein was really about and the reason that they are not Throwing a lot of these people under the bus is because they are actually using these people to leverage Public opinion through their influence and so you have people who own major social media platforms implicated in this You have people who own media outlets implicated in this and they are using the blackmail to To steer the public narrative and the public marketing um and make trends and then they're using like in big tech, you know bot networks and uh They fake profiles and censorship and then Limitation of reach to create these. This is why I said earlier I don't think the people are with any of this stuff. No, like we were talking about the Ukraine flags and the And the trans flags like dude they make it appear That's right. But the reality is is when we go out here in the real world who's really with it There's a tiny little percentage of people that show up and that percentage is getting less and less and less by the day You know, it's not 2020 where hundreds of millions of people fell for one of these psi-op totally right now people are starting to wake up And that's a good thing. Absolutely Yeah, that's a good thing and that's I think that's one of the great services of You know the Trump years exposed the corruption of the media Exposed the corruption of an establishment that now we know at least we're not gonna just be Blind parrots that parrot out whatever were fed Now the next frontier is don't be anybody's blind parrot Because it's not just gonna be the mainstream media that feeds you those lies And one of the things I learned is when you're in that situation where you have lost your trust In say mainstream media or mainstream politicians It goes back to that void, right You still have a void Don't let something else fill that void either so I'm not people cause conspiracy theorists No, I'm not actually a conspiracy theorist. I'm driven by facts and data And if those facts and data defect from what the traditional orthodoxy is great But if those facts and actual details lead me away from whatever Tantalizing conspiracy narrative would be that might be more fun to pursue No, I'm still gonna stay tethered to what's true And the Epstein case it's not that though the the engineered the cameras from the outside I mean, I don't have any evidence to suggest that But it might not have come from the outside And the fact that they deflected all of the attention over there Says that you still got to ask the basic questions that haven't been asked And I think the public at this point deserves to know who's on that client list. I'll publish it when I'm president The dear jazz what's your opinion on declassification? I think I think it should be much more quick than it is today. Yeah, the 20 year justification is just made up I mean if you look at the declassification of those documents Around what we knew about Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9-11 it came 20 years later Yeah, 20 years too late after the government already lied about almost like that Pfizer thing where they tried to Hold that report for 70 years It's just it's just they're trying to stonewall you and saying that nobody's gonna care and filibuster and some sense they're right It works we keep coming up. I think that I think the declassification regime needs to change dramatically I also think this is this entire Invocation of national security as a justification for more or less doing anything. Yeah, is god awful I think the fact I think I think the Pfizer what is the section 7 of the act that allows wiretapping on Any conversation that you have with somebody who isn't a US citizen without a warrant is a bastardization of the fourth amendment in the constitution The United States and so I'm pretty I have pretty strong when it comes to the national security establishments overreach pretty strong libertarian instincts That I'm gonna abide by in the way I lead this country When you think like when we keep coming back to trust right we can come back to trust trust trust That's a big problem for American people right now I truly believe that one of the only ways that we can get trust back is through accountability Yes declassification of information yes in real time the truth I just get to the truth so one thing I've said that I would do in my first month in office Is anytime a government official? Has pressured a private actor to do something that the government official couldn't do directly We will publish it for the world to see that's what Elon did with the Twitter files. That's one company Right and we saw how ugly that was actually wrote about this in January of 2021 I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal with a former law professor of mine saying that What what's really happening is the government is using a combination of carrots and sticks Threats and inducements to get social media companies to silence content that otherwise would have been constitutionally permissible for sure they said at the time that's a conspiracy theory The reality is far worse than we ever imagined Even if one company missing the point bro the politicians are missing the point completely So one of the things And we don't need Congress to do it so we will just Instruct every government agency on pain of penalty that they have to at least publish Roll the log over see what crawls out bring the past aside and I think that's the way we need the next president to act Yeah, there needs to be real regulation around the censorship issues that come from social media senator Eric Schmidt from Missouri was on the show a few weeks ago Good guy. Oh great guy real real guy a real guy that really cares and Eric has been fighting against big tech if as you know he's been filing the lawsuits now One of the things that nobody talks about is How they actually censor they talk about how they just put a warning label or they removed platform and de-platform right like how they did a tromb But that's not really how they censor. Oh, yeah, it's it's all is visible It's the freedom of reach that's right talk about freedom of speech is not freedom of speech And that bullshit that's censor should be us and that's how they craft the narratives and so you might say something But it's purposefully buried by algorithms the other thing is they've Kick it down the chain so it's not the top executives anymore. It's not just it's first it was distributed people little minions Working through the companies so they had plausible deniability right on and it was just a minion now they go from the minion to actually making it AI So here's a dirty little secret within Silicon Valley, okay The way the AI works is it's a trained algorithm right they trained the algorithm to sort of spot who's likely to be suspicious or not I kid you not If you have an American flag on your profile Your speech is more likely to be flagged for review So think about how dystopian that is right now. It's like straight out of or well We're living in it. We're in the United States and if you have a US flag That means that what you say is more likely to be algorithmically surprised. It's insane. It's insane. Yeah insane But but I want to ask you because You know, so you're running for president The deep deep the deep state is an issue. Yes. How do you combat it? So I think the way our system works is actually on pretty solid footing Okay, the US president is empowered by article two of the constitution To run the executive branch of the government Who did I ever thought that there's one executive branch and the US president is actually empowered to use it So read the law. There's the 1977 presidential reorganization act That says that if there are redundant government agencies Or if there are actual agencies that would the shutdown of which would stimulate the economy Then the US president already has the authority from Congress to do it those provisions of the 1977 act are unexpired Read the civil service protection rules like I said earlier. They don't apply to mass layoffs That's why mass layoffs are absolutely what we want to bring to the table You know and you know probably bore your audience here, but five us c 30302 It's a law that gives the US president the sole authority To set the regulations governing the office of personnel management That's the HR department of the executive branch of the federal government what we have missed Is a combination of yes Someone who understands all of that is usually going to be some legal scholar or somebody who's an academic or somebody who Understands it but doesn't want to use that authority because they're part of the system But you need somebody who has an understanding of the laws in the Constitution Combined with somebody who has complete and total disregard for the norms in the administrative state and Washington DC And so I think that that's a rare combination right those qualities don't go together But that's why I said look myself in the mirror We each ask ourselves how are we going to play our part and all it takes this is good news We don't need Congress for this Right congresses in some ways many sense is bought into the system By the same special interests that control congress also want that administrative regulatory state To keep pushing the regulations that protect the people who are in charge in the private sector There's a reason why big companies want to self-regulate because it creates barriers for smaller companies from competing against them So it's that rare combination And outsider who comes in willing to break glass But who also understands the toolkit that the US president can actually wield Not just relying on advisors because advisors are still swamp creatures most of the time They were in Trump's administration for sure. Yeah, that's a rare combination So I can get this job done by the end of my first term 75% head count reduction in the US federal bureaucracy No problem shutting down multiple government agencies no problem It just takes you know the 20s-24 election landing in the right person's unique hands To be able to see that through and that's the one thing I know I can get done So we he promises an hour and a half we're past an hour and a half let me ask the last thing Taxes yes, all right 12% flat tax all right Across the board and by the way eliminated. We're so we're very aligned. I mean, we just you quality of opportunity It was harder for me to I mean I didn't grow up in wealth Why do we want to create a treadmill that makes it harder for people to understand the financial oppression that occurs You understand as a business owner 12% Capital gain ordinary income.
