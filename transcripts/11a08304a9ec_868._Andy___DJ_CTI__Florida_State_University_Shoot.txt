but yes so what's happening no nothing much man a lot of stuff a couple of stuff talk about man yeah some things to discuss yeah man we didn't get to cover anything this week yeah you know but it's all good how you doing you good yeah yeah anything new nope I'm trying to I want to drink out of this this fucking thing the whole episode my right hand is a little tight yeah it's all that beating off oh no there's a viral video of me drinking out of that cup on the internet I haven't seen you yeah I haven't seen it you you you pick it up no problem what do you think I didn't have to pick it up bro I just thought about it you came up on its own is that what yeah this fucking things have you yeah yeah yeah no man we got some I wanted to bring something up for you though because I know you're you're a car guy what what is actually does that mean first like what is what is being a car guy mean it means being passionate about cars outside of the realm of just using them for basic transfer protection that's the first thing it means okay the second thing it means is you're not gay yeah okay yeah I was pretty much it all right well you like cars I do you like cars you know you don't have to have a nice car to be a car guy no not at all right yeah okay all right no you can be it's an aspirational hobby you know what it means like when you're young like Pokemon I don't know I don't know anything about Pokemon I don't think it's like cars though who you catch them all like a you aspire to catch them all do you guys write this to you fucking jokes no bro it's fuck I'm I'm just it's a metaphor I get it you know I'm saying okay yeah yeah same same no but you know why do you stop because it's not the same okay all right you can't compare Pokemon to fucking cars car guy culture car guy culture is is you see a new car car like oh my goodness I want that car yeah car guy culture is like it's probably the most inclusive culture that I think exists because no one cares who you are what race you are yeah how much what they don't care they care about the cars yeah that's real that's what this is a Pokemon it's a good connector yeah that's not Pokemon well Hennessey came out with the new car so are you familiar with like it obviously Hennessey performance right yeah they have a new car yeah and they're saying that it's the world's most powerful the venom production yeah ask venom f5 now is now where I guess let's go through it and you tell me if it's bullshit or not though like is it this is something that's like realistic you know because they're saying zero to 200 in 10.3 seconds I feel like the bugs faster I don't know I don't know the zero to 200 time for the bug yeah because I was too busy not trying to kill myself with this truck but yeah no that's a very fast car really yeah it's a horse power yeah it's yeah they they it's very fast I've got a buddy who has one yeah that's one of these no shit what are these things cost I think they're like two to three million Jesus yeah you know the column of the the fury V8 yeah they're real small you've seen one before when we were down in we were down at Ferrari of Austin there was a Hennessey that used to belong okay Steven Tyler from Error Smith got remember yes I do remember that what I do the rest of us I do okay okay yeah see I thought they did like that like they would just like make the packages that's got an F5 that's the previous version got you but yeah that they're fast huh 2.1 million yeah Jesus Christ what's the BHP is at the base horse what is that break horse power a course power yeah yeah I mean fuck dude yeah but like here's my other quick like why would you even want to go that fast you know I'm saying like why like I feel like there's a limit you know I'm like I've been to some fast shit but like after that it's just like like what what's to it I don't know you know bullshit can you drive that shit yeah I mean it's just awesome dude I don't know how to explain it that's the same argument as why do you like titties why do you want a $5,000 suit if you can get like a $45 suits the same argument why do you have a car if you could get the same place with a with a scooter scooter yeah well because I fucking like it yeah you know like I don't know like you know it's just cool yeah well I think most people that talk like not talk shit but most people they're like oh you they just never been in those cars not only that I mean not everybody's in everything that's true like I don't know why you like Dix you know I'm saying I can't fucking explain that but I don't judge you for it you know it is what the fuck it is it's fucked up yeah well would you get one of these would I get one probably this isn't like a car that you like you're not you like the forrari's in the fucking no I mean the Hennessy makes cool ship bro I mean they they built some awesome stuff it's just I you know it's an American company they make cool stuff yeah I always saw them as like the add-on company like they do the shit with like you know um Chevy or if I perform it stuff right yeah but they make awesome probably made actually call like actually make cars it's crazy huh all right yeah I yeah I mean I probably bought a Conex egg before about that not because I think it's better it's just I like it better like the Conex yeah yeah that's cool I just didn't know if that was like stuff like everybody says it's like oh I got the fastest cars like yeah but do you well I mean look their street cars are faster than that they can build I mean there's a fucking six second quarter mile r8 that underground racing built that's fucking probably the fastest street car made yeah there's a there's a there's a uh four GT called bad GT that runs 310 miles an hour she's so I mean there's all kinds of street cars they're ridiculous fast what makes these cars specials they come out of the box like that yeah what's the fastest car you got the uh top speed or acceleration uh both I guess well acceleration it's the it's the the the pure sport uh Bugatti pure sheer on pure sport yeah the carbon top speed it's the uh it's the Veyron super sport the other Bugatti gotcha yeah yeah that's fucking sick yeah it goes 267 Jesus yeah yeah that's cool man well let's get into our headlines uh we got we got some interest and stuff this is kind of like this first one guys remember if you want to see any of these go to go to anyfusella.com you guys can find this stuff linked there for you um but let's get into our first headline because this one's actually kind of crazy and you know we see these things happen all the time but we never really like dive into I guess like the different arguments for or against them okay but let's let's talk about it because it's going around a whole lot today Florida Florida State University had another mass shooting um at least six people injured in mass shooting at Florida this is today's a couple hours ago oh really yeah um and apparently they're they're saying uh the top of recording at least six people were injured in a mass shooting of uh FSU on Thursday according to hospital officials who had earlier confirmed to CNN it was receiving and treating patients from the campus now FSU put out an alert um on their student messaging platform they also put one out on Twitter um saying that was an active shooter and obviously it's early like there was reports there was actually two shooters one was killed and then one's in custody that is what they're saying right now there is one in custody um you know but uh it's crazy and they're killed one and the rest of the other one that's what they're saying uh that's what they're saying but they they are saying that at least one act like one shooter is in custody so um now there are some clips going around of like you know on the ground and shit that's going on um I have a clip here can't show it on YouTube but I want you to see it because it I think it it also lends to like the problem we have in culture of just this like and what culture it just an American westernized culture it's like we're almost um I don't want to say like fucking like numb to this stuff for something I don't know but the clip is it's a clip of a student on FSU's campus that is walking by one of the bodies or one of the victims um and she's like holding the fucking Starbucks cup and just like to check this clip out man doubles back at it that's the shit right and like you can hear gunshots in the back you're still here yeah yeah still going on go play it again is that going to well it's unconfirmed at the time now there is another one more time you're the yeah you're I do now but there there is enough drinking a fucking ice coffee walk in my past yeah walk right by and like to me like like that's what I'm saying like are people numb to this shit yeah normal people not normal people normal people would help that person or stop and you know move that person or you know I don't I don't and it's not like you were like you were recording walking by this person who who recording who are the shooters they haven't released that yet have a release that there's two of them but that's what the the talk is right now there is another clip uh that apparently uh shows a police officer rendering aid to what appears to look like that same person that was laying on the ground here's this clip yeah so we don't know if she's you know passed or not you know it looks like she got shot in the in the butt yeah right like not in the torso torso yeah yeah um you know but it is crazy because you know they haven't released the names of the shooter the identity of the shooter or shooters um but of course you got people jumping to conclusions there was this person um who goes by Thomas mix on twitter uh saying another active shooter this time at SFU Florida let's talk about why this keeps happening Florida passed permitless carry in 2023 no training no license no permit anyone 21 to know there without a felony can out carry a hidden gun no registration no oversight just vibes and violence this is the direct result of GOP governance Republicans in Florida don't care they did they actually do something but they don't because debt college kids aren't a political liability to them most of their mega base isn't sending kids to university anyway so when bullets fly on campus it's not their problems they sold public safety to the gun lobby the NRA right to their bills gun violence is just background noise to their power games i mean z-shon what's the definition of a criminal i want to come it's a crime and the one who doesn't obey laws okay so that's like the official description correct yeah so so this person Thomas who apparently is highly educated because you know mega people don't spend send their kids to college right yeah super educated so this is an educated you know dude who thinks that criminals somehow obey laws and that gun laws would stop this kind of behavior is that am I understanding this correct yeah okay so so how does he come to the conclusion that a law would stop people from doing these kinds of things does anybody can anybody answer that for me i have a question for you though there are a lot of car accidents what should we should what should we do probably bank cars yeah it's just like the fat people yeah we should probably just ban spoons in place yeah we shouldn't actually you know make the food healthier and ban the ingredients that are intentionally put in the food that make it addictive by all of the big food producers no that's not just take the forks out of people's hands that's right so this is Thomas here brother yeah he looks like a smug douchebag with this fucking star track cup okay this is what's wrong with the world is people that think this way first of all we're using people being shy some sort of political agenda push narrative push politicizing the tragedy right which doesn't surprise me because that's what everybody jumps to do but i would be interested to find out who actually committed this shooting and what their history is and who they are because i'm willing to bet that it's probably not some mega hillbillies like they're trying to and by the way bro just so you know if we were to test the the IQ of mega base versus people like you they would destroy you okay like there's this myth amongst these east coast and west coast people that believe that their little areas that they live in are it yeah and they think they're they're really fucking smart because they went to a school that told them they were smart right right and they can't they lack the capacity to look around their life and be like man my life sucks maybe it's my fault maybe i don't know as much as i think i do instead you know they sit there with in their ignorance with their spot cup and drink expensive coffee and pretend that you know everybody else is wrong so i don't know i mean clearly it's a culture problem that we have here in the country it's has nothing to do with guns well i mean that's the thing it's like because i really i want to like they'll tell you it's mental health issue or video games or tiktok but the truth they've created society where it's easier to get a gun than health care housing and education um first of all it would be easier to get a gun than health care housing or education because guns are cheap and those things are expensive so it's always going to be easier secondly um um you're implying there should be some sort of regulation to make it harder when in reality the people who legally go and get these guns typically aren't the ones that commit these crimes and by the way how many of these crimes are stopped by armed citizens that we never hear about a lot that's right we never hear about it dude a lot okay so i don't know what's up i'm pulling up some statistics like illinois has some of the most strictest gun laws high-scrime you don't say like yeah and it's always interesting when they leave this shit out like when they intentionally don't tell you it kind of like i mean i i mean look dude these people are insane they're they they're insane what's the history say like what's the last like a couple of mashews we've been having who's been doing it trans people and people that are you know he says oh you'll say it's a mental health issue well yeah we do because the people doing it typically are people that don't even know if they're a man or a woman and they're pissed off the trans shooters manifesto was recently declassified and if you go in there and read it it's highly disturbing um but these are people that are products of this person's belief system so we have all of these mentally ill people they're all far leftist they these people put out the narrative that this is white supremacy or maga or whoever when in reality there hasn't been any of the mass shootings committed by these people no so they're saying oh you're the extremist who's more extreme the people actually committing violence or the mava people who are not committing fucking where are these acts of white supremacy where are these videos that we see over and over and over again of groups of white people terrorizing malls and uh uh where where are we seeing this this isn't happening dude we're not seeing this anyway well I want to so okay so question like how do we what what would you say is the the realistic is there a way to stop school shootings is there a way to stop like what's the solution here it's very simple we have all kinds of veterans and all kinds of security officers and police officers that are not employed anymore or maybe they're retired and they're looking for a new career maybe they maybe you know they deployed when they were younger and now they don't there's all kinds of people that will fill these jobs why don't we take some of the budget from the uh you know how to cut off your penis in you know Kazanaka stand right studies and we put that towards employing some of our men and women who are taught in these skill sets to be armed on these campuses why would we not do that yeah there's only one reason we wouldn't do it it's because the result of it can be politicized to their favor which is exactly what this guy's doing yeah we let's politicize this but not the shit that happens in Chicago yeah right well what did this guy post about that kid getting stabbed down there in Texas yeah right what he post about that yeah what he post about that kid what about that other guy uh who who just almost got to capitated at a bus stop that we talk about that yeah right that isn't even that hasn't even been made the fucking news dude dude was at a bus stop with his fucking family he bent down and another dude smacked him in the back of the neck with a hand or a hatchet and killed him we're not hearing about that you know why because it doesn't fit their fucking agenda so bro everybody knows what's going on we all know this is the next phase of division and manipulation that's happening and it's sad too man it's sad that like that's what it's come down to you know because it's like the it's like it's like the trusty old fucking you know teddy bear so I'm just like every any time I get all this fails bring it out bring out that race card yeah 100% but dude look with their they're they're they're going to continue to blame it on on the far right and white supremacy until people stand the fuck up and say what the fuck are you talking about no and not enough people will do that because they're afraid they're going to be they've been traumatized for a decade and a half being called racist for breathing the fucking error okay so until people stand the fuck up and say and eight us doing this shit for fuck you talking about the focus is going to continue to be on us all right the statistics and the data are what the fuck they are they are they are what the fuck they are and everybody out there knows what the data actually says period all right so it's it comes from leftists it comes from confused trans people it comes from people that are somehow connected to the FBI uh it comes from a black violence problem and those are realities that's realities okay so I don't know that's not that is not racist that's just pointing out the fuck is statistical data and if anybody wants to challenge it go look at the mass shootings that have happened for the last five six years and you know I don't know observe who did them you you could take a picture of the faces of the people that did and you could tell very quickly who the fuck it is doing the crimes so you know until people want to have an honest conversation about these things it's pointless yeah my heart's and prayers out to those those affected down there man it's a tough situation it's it's sad I'm sure what one know very shortly you know what color head die was used um out listen bro it we all we all know it's going to be yeah it's going to be a far leftist it's going to be some sort of trans person it's going to be some sort of communist person those are the people that are committing the fucking legal aliens or some shit yeah it could be that those are the people committing the fucking crimes and they're going to make it about white supremacy which is fucking insane okay maybe I'm wrong I don't know like maybe I'm wrong maybe it's a couple red necks from fucking floor demands right all right maybe that's what it is but I'm willing to wage or not knowing yet that that is not the case because we don't see that happening it's not happening it's just not it's not my guy something what do you let me ask you something yeah what's I'm curious because I know you speak for all the black people you're the official representative of national black people associates yes I am so why is it that this kid in Austin stabs this other kid in the heart and kills him mm-hmm and now all the sudden he's a victim there's all these black people saying well this kid got what he deserved because he put hands on this kid or this you know this he's the victim of this or they were doing this or that the motherfucker killed another kid that kids never gonna fucking go home to his parents he died in his brother's fucking arms okay he's never gonna have a Christmas he's never gonna have a family he's never gonna grow up and get married his whole life is over it's fucking over okay this doesn't just go away when the internet stops covering it the guy's gone all right how can anybody how can anybody defend that I mean the pieces of the shit okay so why is it why is it in black culture that I'm asking a serious question why is it in black culture when a black person commits a crime that other black people defend the person that committed the crime that is not something that happens in white culture no I think I think I think they lack I think I think there's some some internal issues going on there because I mean bro like I mean to me it's common fucking it's common sense bro like the dude is fucked up and like the part that really pisses me off about all of that too I've been seeing it so stupid but his dudes raised a fucking go fund me they're selling fucking T shirts and shit of them now and it's like like I saw like something about like his the Metcath's dad went to like the press conference just some shit and he's like oh it was disrespectful for him to come to the press conference it's like completely just throwing away the actual victim of the situation but like what makes it even more irritating bro is like the amount of like black kids who are victims of other black kids that they don't even like there's no go go fund these for those there's no fucking bro bro bro it's so I get called racist for pointing out that there's a fucking crime problem that is statistically backed by hard data with black males okay but look bro no but look that's not racism racism is acting like it doesn't happen so that it continues to happen right that's racism yes I agree I agree I'm just dude like bro it's just disgusting man now it's sick it's sick it's sick but yeah I was putting it out to those down on the fsu man and I'm sure we'll learn more about the ins and outs of this situation this time goes but guys jump down in the comments let us know what you guys think I mean if it was white supremacist like the guys trying to say and fucking maggot I already identified it huh we've already would have known who did it we would have known names and addresses yeah why hold on yeah question another question how come we don't know anything about the dude the shot trunk we haven't heard anything about it or though the second guy either that's right you know the second guy why why why is that by the end of the day we'll know everything about these motherfuckers but we still won't know about the guy that shot Trump and Trump's not talking about it either it is weird it is weird it is weird man it is weird guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being sad man you understand what I'm saying though why'd you say like is it not more racist to pretend that there's not a problem with black unblack crime and black crime in general isn't that more racist no for sure to not care about it and to pretend like it doesn't exist and then get them to rally up and vote for you to make it go away of the you know the problems that don't exist yeah all right well you know at some point people are gonna have to give vocal dude and like on an individual level you know what I mean the saying a fucking white dude problem the saying this is a fucking problem that the communities need to come together acknowledge and try to fix 100% guys with that being said man let's go cruise some of these comments we got some we got some good ones here this first comment comes from Matt remote remote Romano 82 Matt Romano 82 says usually a

second headline and on number two um there was a space flight space right oh yeah going up to space space yeah uh blue origin crew including gale king and katie parry returned safely after space launch they were among the six women who made a 10 minute trip on blue origins new shepherd rocket as the first all female space crew and more than a hundred more than 60 years now i'm glad they all know what women are now i mean you know that's cool oh shit all women crew you know about that no shit no shit uh but of course you know like being in all women crew you still got to i mean yeah we're getting trouble with this one well how do they find their way back how they stopped to pee on the way they're back well i was gonna say you know that's a long trip with no pee breaks you make a milestone like that you know all women crew and there's still gonna be some shit to complain about hey gale king she has a complaint oh really she has a complaint let's check in with gale king this is what she had to say i don't like that people are calling it a ride a ride you know i never see a man a male astronaut who's going up in space and they said oh we took a ride we actually duplicated the route that Alan Shepherd did that's why it's called this particular capsule is called the new shepherd we duplicated that route that route no one said he took that ride yeah it's always referred to as a flight or a journey so i feel that that's a little disrespectful to what the mission was and what the work the blue origin does we use space technology all the time whether it's your gps whether it's your satellite that doesn't just happen every time a flight goes up they get some type of information two of the astronauts i still have a hard time calling myself an astronaut but two of the of cuz you're not because you went on a fucking ride you trained for fucking 30 years you did pass any fucking NASA exams you're not an astrophysicist you don't know how to fucking do shit you put a fucking blue suit on and pretended to go to space for the fucking press you're not a fucking astronaut you want to ride yep it was a ride my first question that came to my mind was why were these people selected specifically why are they no other women in America who are more deserving that's where my mind went like dude the kitty Perry really yeah I know I know I would call it a ride it's for like 10 minutes my father that's shorter than like most people sex yeah well maybe not but for leverage six minute 40 seconds yeah the average of sex four minutes six minutes and 40 seconds really yeah how you know that I'm an average reader you meant fucking you're working up trying to get above average I'm always above average there you go I would have never thought any differ you're from fucking India you know the land of commas that's right cock was the idea know how to do it that's why they got billions of people well I mean the time thing there I mean they would have to do it quick though technically right all jokes all jokes aside mm-hmm shut the fuck up well I mean dude I got a look in the the qualifications to become an astronaut you need to be a US citizen possess a master's degree and a stem field so science technology engineering mathematics have two years of related work experience or 1,000 hours of being a pilot in command on a jet aircraft and you have to pass NASA's long duration flight astronaut physical which she did none nope she has a bachelor's from University of Maryland she's known for being Oprah's friend that's what you're known for you're known for being Oprah's friend yep nope that's that's your claim to fame yeah if I've ever known for being someone's friend and that's how the world knows me fucking put it do like eliminate me yeah right right right nicely you know you know send you to space bro first of all I don't believe they went to space at all well dude did you see the video when it came down dude okay so let's talk do you have that I have it okay because there's some conspiracy around this man no there's not they fucked up their little theatrics and got caught check this clip out okay now I want you to watch the hatch door open from the inside the lady runs over there real quick says no no no shits door back tries to stand in front of it I agree spaces fucking fake are going to space as fake I don't think they went up there no they fucking didn't go up there bro it's bullshit it's propaganda bullshit there's there's no way bro they're like in the the fucking the capsule wasn't like burned up or anything didn't have any fucking I don't know why people aren't treating me like an astronaut I don't know why they're calling it a ride I don't know like I'm getting this treated oh it's because they're racist yeah that's where the next thing was gonna be misogynist shut the fuck up yeah well there's also some other stuff I saw this other conspiracy theorist they said that apparently there was a fucking mannequin inside of it did you see this oh I'm broke let me ask you this yeah what about the women who actually did do all of this training what about the women who did do all of these things what what about the women who in history like on the challenger were killed right I was in first grade I watched on TV I remember watching it it was a fucking it was disturbing everybody was crying and shit like it was fucking crazy but what about all the women who have been training for this what about like to your point exactly right yeah like what about all the women in the space program they never got a chance to go to space exactly right out of all the women in America there are no women who are deserving less than these people yeah dude it's also acting like she flew the fucking thing up there I don't know why people are calling me a uh why they're treating me like an astronaut it was a ride there are rides that fucking six flags that last fucking ten minutes no shit there's what's that one Thunder River Thunder River yeah that's a long one all right it's right that's a ride thank you get right I like that right I like I like it too but the problem is you're out there on a hot day and your shorts get wet and then you got you got a chafing going on it's not good do you do roll coasters and shit yeah yeah I used to not to when I was a kid but now like I would do in them now yeah bro yeah yeah let's do it let's go Disney world um yeah there was this fucking uh there's this conspiracy theory about like a mannequin was on board really so they caught it like you know why they were down there this guy MJ truth ultra uh his name on twitter posted this out uh saying something is definitely wrong with the blue origin spaceflight that Katy Perry was on social media users are asking why are there why are the reentry burn marks where are the reentry burn marks and why does that look like a fake hand um because it is well like do I mean the picture yet like that looks like a fucking mannequin tan bro like i think gal keens and why was the door so easy to open and why did Jeff Bezos have to act like it was a special tool he needed to use to open it like I don't know why yeah I don't believe it though I don't believe it at all okay well here's something you might you might want to believe because this is the in a parallel topic uh did you see the u.s government announced it has achieved the ability to manipulate space and time yeah we we knew that they announced it yeah I know but we people have been trying to say this for years there's declassified fucking documents from the CIA that have shown that they have the ability to do things like astral projection and remote viewing and uh you know quantum physical attraction like all of these things are real things like humans have the capacity to visualize and create with their brain and all of the high achievers that have been known as high achievers over the history of time talk about this they talk about it and everybody thinks it's Matt it's bullshit magical shit and this is what i'm talking about when I say they've lied to us about our own capabilities so yeah I mean I saw them admitted but I wasn't I wasn't surprised yeah well for those of you that haven't seen the check this clip out um this is a guy get what his name is and where he's at but yeah I mean it's a pretty pretty interesting clip let's check it out our passenger planes are slower than they used to be our trains crawl compared to those other parts of the world our cars do not fly advances have not stopped but something has gone wrong stagnation was a choice we have weighed down our builders and innovators the well-intentioned regulatory regime of the 1970s became an ever tightening ratchet first hampering america's ability to become a net energy exporter and then making it harder and harder to build we seem to have lost focus in vision to have lowered our sights and let systems and structures and bureaucracies muddle us along but we are capable of so much more our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space they lead distance annihilated cost things to grow and improve productivity it's weird so my my I guess my question is then so like okay if we know that that is true then why are they still lying about going up there now then like I mean what what so what is what is it like how does it work then I don't know but why is I mean if they're if they have the ability to what do you say eradicate no you say annihilate annihilate distance yeah why don't they annihilate some of the distance between Katy Perry's eyebrows in her hairline that's all I think of when I look at that picture let's annihilate some of that distance yeah those are some nice astronaut suits though didn't base those each shit walking around the capsule thing too did he fall now I mean I don't know dude this seems this seems like it absurdity to me I don't know why I don't know what the thing is here or what it is or whatever or something maybe it's a stunt to get investment or I don't fucking know not that you need it dude's fucking probably I don't know he probably own space you know I'm saying there's an Amazon store there yeah anyway same thing with the with eyebrows she got the same thing I'm not a fan of any of these people these are mainstream celebrity people that you know why are you not treating me like an astronaut what because you're fucking not you're not a fucking astronaut are you an astronaut I know no no you got to go play ride once on a pilot yeah I mean where you call it a ride it was a flight they're discriminating against me that's like the same same route as they're discriminating against against women yeah fuck up yeah that's why you guys jump it on this con you know what I'm more tired of I'm just tired of people on places of privilege like for real crying about their oppression and their fucking these things like lady you're one of the most privileged people on the fucking planet okay you're a mainstream celebrity for whatever reason I don't know all right because the the what she's insinuating is that people are not giving her the proper amount of respect you know like bro shut the fuck up because you're an astronaut yeah we got fucking Michelle Obama talking about oppression in front of the whole world bitch you're the fucking first lady or whatever farmer for for for something first German yeah but I'm just saying like what it what what is this yeah yeah it's so good I don't believe this I think it's bullshit that's just my opinion maybe I'm wrong you know maybe I need to become an astronaut so that I can experience let's do it first hand let's go take a flight to this space yeah guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let's know what you guys think that being said I third and final headline man this is this is a weird one I caught out of left field this is why we lost so we talk about you know having to step up the like there's a cultural shift happening in the country right now I guess it's good to see like I guess it's it's good to see I don't know you guys tell me what you guys think down in the comments there's this video that was posted on Instagram let's check this out this is why we lost part two you tell we just said you fucking passion or not as hell thank you they're mad as hell but now they're you know they're celebrating their song yeah this is why they lost exactly right it was kind of catchy it's always the same suspects is it not is it not that good at leave here yeah it's the same mother fuckers the Subaru haircut yeah it's the same people you you you could listen to the words and and guess correct you guys listening on audio they look exactly like you think they look yeah we have so much at home I don't have anything to do what should I do I should just get angry make a song about how angry I am and then black people will like me yeah yeah they won't rob me yeah no really with their thinking I don't know what they're thinking I think these people grow up with no challenges in their life and they decide that they need to become important and this is how they become important where where are the black people singing the song you know what I'm saying where the black people listen to the shit though well we know that they ain't listening to that they wasn't there I mean that had mayonnaise all over it bro yeah no bro no they're bringing raisins for sure I think it's important like do there is a shift though like the shift is happening I mean this this guy you know he I'm not on one like you know this ain't the only reason you guys lost it's because every single fucking point that is important your logic is completely backwards right no for sure like that's that's why you lost and it keeps following on it so yeah follow on itself and when people are calling it out like I was looking to the comments on this video this one guy or one person burns burns C 802 put on the video say as a farmer Democrat I can tell you that you're 100% right I didn't leave the left they left me the constant race baiting, wokeness, anti-free speech, anti-tuA the double standards are so beyond ridiculous wide open borders and enforcing us to pay for housing and healthcare for illegals while we have so many Americans in the street the list is so long I won't go into more the thing that person doesn't sound like you sound like a common sense American that's not Democrat or Republican like this is the problem the the associating yourself and your thoughts with an identity that then you dilute your own thoughts and your own thinking to cater to that quote unquote identity and be more inclusive with them right like this isn't dude if you really want to fucking make a difference stop saying I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat or I'm a libertarian and start saying these are my thoughts I believe in this this and this yeah these are my thoughts like I don't identify with any of these people any party people were confused by it too because like there's you know I'll see clips get posted out where you know I'm criticizing you know Trump and people will say in the comments things like fucking Hillary lover yet well they had those they'll say oh Andy's turn into one of them or they are you know I can like guys will be like oh I I he's finally seeing the light listen dude I call it how I see it and that's how we should all be doing it all of us should be able to comprehend think and come up with a opinion on these issues independently not because the group says that we agree with all of these points right like if you're a Democrat you have to agree that guns are bad and and censor speech and be woke like that's not that none of that shit defines should define a person's thinking no and I think the biggest problem that we have in society is that we are collectively trying to find identities in these groups you know what I'm saying like why why do we get to a point where you feel the need to choose a side instead of just choosing what you think and having discussions and being able to defend those points yeah I believe in this and this and this and this yes this is the he'll allow Dio and this is kind of below the bar and if you want to take it and now a step further what what would make it better how would we do it differently so it was made better yeah that's not a conversation that happens over well I know because there's no leadership dude it's all clout chasing bullshit from both sides so they could sell a mother fucking shirt or whatever they're doing right you got people that fucking well here's a reality the internet's full of low IQ people I don't know what the fuck it say like if you if you don't have and and honestly weak people okay because if you don't have the courage to say what it is that your opinions are or you don't have the capacity to communicate those opinions and and say why you think those things you're not thinking yeah at all well that's a problem they don't believe in what they're saying that's I don't think they know what they're saying it's part of the problem like how can you have courage just to say something that you don't really know if you 100% believe it I I agree but there's also plenty of people that do have beliefs that lack the courage to communicate and yeah and what's happened is because we've been what were they said I don't know how you guys were brought up but my generation was brought up that you don't talk about politics you don't talk about politics don't talk about politics but yet the other side that's all they fucking talk about okay so I feel like that we've been indoctrinated culturally to stay quiet all right and this is why white people have been told their races for having any opinions that's what takes just a quiet yeah that's right don't say anything you might get canceled fuck you I'm gonna say whatever the fuck I want how about that okay and that's what everybody should be doing all right do I get some heat sometimes sure but also I get to go to bed at night saying you know what dude there isn't a person out here doesn't know how I feel about shit I'm not hiding it I'm not carrying this weight around about how I truly feel and too afraid to say it like where are the real Americans that are going to stand up with independent thought and say hey all of you people are fucking crazy yeah well I think that goes back to the point of like the cultural change that's happening society because I mean I wish I went through the comments on just this video this lady Jane Doe as a black woman I asked you to stop and I was putting it in support in there yeah mister pes canova says full blown retardation you know it's coming it's coming it's just been a slow fucking train man it's just been a certain these two people four years ago were cheering the shit on and now you know now it's become the flavor to criticize it it's like dude look I was watching TV last night in my in my bar and I looked you know I was actually working but I had the TV on you know how I do yeah yeah so I scan I'm sitting here like this is this is like I don't know one in the morning and I'm sitting here thinking I'm like all right I'm thinking about all these things that I need to do with myself and the companies and my personal brand and I'm working through all these things and I'm thinking like super hard about them right like how should we do this and what's the best way to do that and how do we do this and and then like my eyes gazed up at the TV and the headline on the bottom of the TV this is on Fox News was something to the effect of men and women's sports okay and I stopped and I thought about it I'm like here I am trying to intelligently craft and think through some of the very hardest things to do in the world which is to effectively run companies it's the highest most competitive game you could play and I look up and I see people on national television arguing over what a man or a woman is and when you really think about how far society has regressed to where that's an actual headline on television it's pretty absurd right yeah like you're you're little girls know what a man or woman is yeah and here we have what's supposed to be the most intelligent the best and the brightest the political commentators arguing over what a man and a woman is and that's what we've been reduced to as a culture and society we haven't celebrated like true innovation or true success in so long we've stalled yeah and now and dude it really makes me think about some shit so I started thinking about some shit more and I started thinking about why did they do this why did they why did they indoctrinate people to be so fucking stupid why do we remove competitive nature from society why do we tell these kids that they're gonna win just by existing and breathing yet why do we do all these things and as I'm thinking this I'm also talking to chat GPT in my fucking hand which by the way you guys know that I think there's there's ethical issues with AI but as I'm as I'm talking to chat GPT it occurs to me that this is their way of forcing literal slavery into society dumb down the population make them completely fucking inept introduce this technology that removes the ones that are decent it removes their opportunity by creating a tool that is superior and can do all of these things which by the way they've had for many many years the point is I'm sitting here thinking about why all of this is happening and dude like these people are gonna have to have a universal basic income they're gonna have like there's no avoiding it there's no there's no effort to curtail AI and what it's capable of doing it's not been done you see what I'm saying like bro and I don't think people understand they don't understand that if you work for a company and you are not extremely fucking valuable your job will not exist in a year it will not exist period and in one year it will not exist because what I tell you that they were going to force how they were going to force the adoption I told you it would be greed and now we have companies replacing entire departments of people with this fucking program you know why they're replacing entire departments of people because entire departments of people don't give it they're all entire departments to people think that they're going to be employed forever and they don't have to get better they do things because they're easy not because they're right we're we're doing most people like if you have a job right now and you're not working to be the absolute fucking best at what you do irreplaceable I think you're fucked yeah yeah well I mean it's interesting I mean we've been talking about this for years talking about a dude and it's like I think it's like really four years ago bro I said I said dude now is your time to do this if you do not do this the opportunity window will close and now we're here it's closing it is fucking closing man and like an extra thing it's like I've always battled with that it's like the net what's the is it a net positive net negative and it's like yeah there's some cool things you can do with AI you know I'm saying like that's cool but like what's the overall is this good for humanity and it's like but that may be the other reason too of why there are no talks about regulations because they know it's necessary because we've gotten to a point is now they brought us to a point like that on purpose that man who just said that innovation has been stifled yeah and uh that's that's intentional yeah it's been going over 30 years now we have a fucking now we have a society that would gladly welcome a universal basic income to not work and not realizing that that's going to basically mean their impoverty for their whole lives you know what I mean yeah so crazy man guys I I can see the picture a little clearer every single day man and if you're not if you're not able to think thinking is going to become the gold standard hmm that's what you're gonna get paid for yeah the tools the tools will be there instantly but if you can't creatively think or know how to use the tools you're gonna be obsolete and it's gonna be in a year it's gonna be in one fucking year that's how fat this isn't five years from now this is 12 months from now 12 months from today the unless some serious regulation is put in or the culture decides that we are only going to support companies that employ real people which dude I don't think that's gonna happen I don't I don't people know that Amazon is bad for the economy for for working class people but they still use it you see what I'm saying uh people know that we should be supporting American companies but you know they say they support those companies but the minute that if something is inconvenient they don't think about it they're just like whatever so we we have a big problem dude it's a big it's gonna be well I don't have a big problem but most people have a big problem and if if you're young and you're or you have a job of any sort you better dedicate your entire fucking next year of your life becoming the absolute biggest contributor to whatever it is that you do or it's gonna be smell you later bro yeah that's just reality guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said it's our final segment thumbs up or dumb as fuck um it kind of lead way to write into this is about AI what I thumbs up and dumb as fuck is this maybe one of the you know I guess lighthearted uses of AI let's talk about it our thumbs up or dumb as fuck head on reads people are utilizing chat GPT to turn their dogs into humans have you seen this um okay so yeah see this is what this is what people who are gonna be on universal basic income do with chat GPT will be doing yeah this is what they do the non-being serious yeah there's gonna be two kinds of people there's gonna be people that waste their time doing shit like this and there's gonna be people that utilize that to become a fucking weapon it's gonna take the effective people and make them a thousand times more effective and it's gonna take the everybody else and very expose them to the maximum degree of how ineffective they are that's it yeah yeah they're putting the the man and man's best friend um so yeah so there's uh I guess it's a new trend thing going around on social media so I got some of the pictures here let's just take a look see what you think yeah um oh man that's pretty funny yeah that's pretty good that's a little french I would say that's how dog is that that's not a French that's
