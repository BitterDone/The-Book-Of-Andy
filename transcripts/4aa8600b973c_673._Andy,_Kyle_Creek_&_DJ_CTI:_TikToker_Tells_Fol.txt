That's right. We do we do need some comes in shoot it Yeah, DJ DJ's the drag this day. I almost told them Stole his intro again How I usually steal the motherfucking internet intro which I've done every other time I almost still stole it from it's fine Won't be the first thing I got stolen from you say so the way around So guys welcome Mr. Kyle Creek to the show it's good to see you bro. Thanks, man. That was so fast I fucking sharpshooter Yeah, I gotta told you I've become a plant nerd recently. I think we talked about that. I've been laying low Took Instagram off my phone a couple months ago, and I've really just been focused on Planting trees at my house and writing books and it's been nice Would you become one of these great of Thunberg weirdos? No, I'm not that kind of weird. I'm trying to make up for your carbon footprint Not a good no guys. We're just talking about how the new truck. I want to get that new big dodge Okay, I don't make up for the opposite. There we go. So you're planting the trees to make up for the truck. Yes, it's all a balance The thing that you say doesn't exist. Yeah, I'm a towel Yeah, I'm gonna wait hold on. I gotta get into this. How did you get into plants? Because like you show up here and all of a sudden you're fucking botanist like what's going on? Yeah, I think it's my personality when I get into something I get addicted pretty hard Yeah, and so I just I've got this new place down in Florida and I was just trying to plant originally I was just trying to create some privacy between me and my neighbors And so I was trying to find plants that grow big and wide and so I started researching and then I just got into it I didn't realize there was like 50 different kinds of palm trees I want to make sure I was planting stuff that wasn't gonna get my dog sick And so I just be kind of came a plant nerd and like I said I walked into your scour the internet for pretty much I just been reading about plants like a lot like if you look at like the ads I'm getting served now up on the Google ad server like they're all for like plant farms and nurseries and stuff. It's funny Are you into that shit? No, I mean no No, I'm gonna give me a lot of the difference between any plants, bro Well, you got a Chinese fan palm when you first walk in the big one in your Yeah, I mean you're up here in Missouri. Oh really Chinese fan palm. Oh, I know We pay a whole bunch of money for our plants in here. So we got fucking China in the building That would just pretty much you should check that that's probably The transmitter from the Chinese Bible Now wait now we got Christmas you're any fucking vegan right? No, all right. No No, that shit. No, we meet. But yeah, I mean in six months. I'll probably move on to another hobby It's just how I've always been though like if I'm gonna get into something I want to really get into it. Yeah, well I mean that makes sense because like dude you have a Wide variety of knowledge on just things That I appreciate that that's probably why right? Yeah, I mean it is it is that's why you know I get no I just It's probably bad in the sense because I hop around a lot like I don't really stick to things too much Excited aside from writing and this one thing in my life. I've always wanted to really stick to but as far as like hobbies man I've always been all over the bro meet. I'm like that too, dude Like once I get that once I get it. I'm like okay. This is what it's about I'm like on of the next thing super into it Then I'm like all right. No plants now I got to figure it now I'll get into fish next I'll dig a pond and I'll start putting weird fish in it I don't cross the threshold into like master of the thing I just like I get like to where I'm like okay better and better than most here's what it is Yeah, I understand it and then I'm like all right. This is boring But that's still more than most people will ever do yeah, and that's what I think is cool And that's probably why you and I get along because I feel like we can talk about a lot of different subjects too And we all have at least like some knowledge of one of those things. Yeah, I'm not we you know how like some people They get into shit and then they stay into it forever like Star Wars. Mm-hmm or golf They're fucking Star Wars people They're a perfect example of that shit, bro. They get into it when they're fucking five and they stay there You know what hands deal with yeah Look there's some cool shit in Star Wars. Yeah, there is like the big walkers those big walkers I was 80s bro. I wanted one of the giant like you pretty much have one now with your tanks Yeah, but it has you need to call your guy and say hey, I want one of these AT AT I do I want the four walker the four One for like a two one looks a little unstable and then you need to get that power loader from aliens that Ripley comes out and when she grabs the queen and you need a power loader too dude I don't know man. I might want the power loader more. Well imagine that out in your warehouse. Yeah, they'll be badass. I think you should get one Someone's career who could build me a power loader somewhere someone is really guys can do it Let's do it. You know what I really want You know you know in a Pacific Rim. I never saw that. Oh, bro the Jaggers in Pacific Rim. Nope They're like these big fucking 300-foot tall transformer things and these do you drive them and they fight each other? I think I thought you said some Jaggers like we can get you some Jagger. I know about the Jagger I mean they have up there was a Meister. There was a Jagger bro Is that a Pacific Rim? Isn't that Pacific Rim isn't this just giant robots fighting? Yeah, but there was another movie like that back in the fucking 90 or the 80s called robot jocks Nobody remembers that I've heard that but it never said it was the same premise as Pacific Rim But it was called robot jocks. Yeah, those big ass robots dude So dude Google robot jocks. This is like rock them sock them robots, but brought to life. Yeah Do you remember that game as a kid? Yeah, no, no, here it is dude. It's it's there it is robot jocks J.O. X. Oh go up to Google there Go that top picture there on the right you kind of see what they're like Yeah, so they're like these like power Rangers when they come together and create those giant robots. Yeah, but less gay I don't know about that part. We have yet you know, it was wrong with power Rangers Here's the tight Rangers is pretty fucking is a gay. I think so. Oh man. I was I remember when I think it's actual I think it's programming I remember when I think I think the black one the black power Ranger wasn't really black That disappoint you a little bit a little bit Because I thought they were all the color that they were so you think it was red people and pink people listen Braw was young man. Do you think the red guy was like an Indian? No, I thought it was a white guy. I got some burnt Fuck dude All right Onward this guy. Yeah, man. It's clean. That's a fucking pimp right there. What is that what is that building? That's the Villas are autumn museum and it's beautiful. Augustine Florida. So this was some guy's summer home He lived in Florida. Yeah, he lived in Boston most of the time and then he built the summer home for himself down in St. Augustine I think it was like the late 1800s and the interior of that home is one of the most beautiful things you've ever seen But there's so many these cool old homes down there in Florida. What architecture is that considered? Looks like it like I don't know what that be at least in for sure I mean, that's like some Asian inspired. It's cool. Yeah, it's rad You know what I like bro. I think we should get back to is like Gothic type. Yeah, I got the Romanesque Yeah, I like I like the Richard Sony and Romanesque, which is what you see a lot of down in St. St. Louis like the downtown the stone work in the turrets Yeah, that's like a combination like you know like the outside of the Union station until like that kind of stuff's gorgeous dude We we people don't realize that there's a actual reason Why buildings don't look that way and it has nothing to do with what they cost to make? They just want to make you depressed. Yeah, that's right. It's called brutalism. It's demoralization of society. It's the big heavy concrete They don't want you to have pride in your in your city and your country It's about removing pride and everything well It's like when you were talking about a recent episode and you're saying if you tell us one Are you gonna lay a thousand bricks and just create a three mile wall? Or are you gonna lay a thousand bricks and create like this beautiful cathedral? It's the same thing when you have when you have a city center that has a cathedral in it that took 50 years and hundreds of Artisans to make like anyone in that town is gonna feel connected and be like wow This is a beautiful piece of art. Yeah, my grandpa did the stonework there Oh, my my dad was the glass guy that was doing the stained glass Like you're gonna have this pride, but when you when everything looks like a parking structure You don't give a fuck about it. That's right. That's intentional. You're not gonna fight for it You're not gonna fight to save it and you go to these city centers now and you you sitting like these wind tunnels Where everything's just uncomfortable and people are sitting out you know trying to sit down on a steel bench trying to Sandwich and no one looks happy anymore, but then you go to Europe where they still have a lot of that stuff is you know Everyone talks about oh, I love the European culture because there's a lot of you know Dining on patio and people socializing. We'll look at the areas. They're doing it in like they're still built for that Whereas you know our modern cities are not designed to accommodate that kind of social connection or just like you're saying like The pride in something beautiful Dude have you been to Barcelona? No, I've not but I've scoured the internet. You should go Yeah, it's some of the coolest architecture. Have you been to Barcelona? Yeah, when did you go? Yeah? Fuck I don't know. It was probably it had to be like oh Who I'm just surprised whenever I hear you've left your house like If I see you leave Missouri, I'm like oh shit. I had these go in places. Yeah, that's a that's more recent dude like that's really since kind of like COVID and You know since I started doing this show like yeah I just don't like COVID really kind of fucked up my ability to go out in public like with the people who are asking you and screaming at you and like I don't forget things so for me Like I when I go out now I look at everybody and I'm like those are motherfuckers that will fucking turn on me in a fucking second Scream at me and shit and they're not saying shit right now You know and like it's just a very inauthentic. I don't know I know it's wrong to think that but like that's how I feel do you guys authentic story word for yeah It's like you guys were fucking you guys are all in here acting like we're all nice and cool bro You were telling people to put us in fucking camps. I just don't forget that shit, you know like and unfortunately You know with this show, you know, we deal with like you asked me earlier we deal with a lot of like fucking weirdos that like show up and You know they don't agree with the things I say and I you know, I just fucking stay at home, bro And then I got fucking like You know as you build a business and as you become more successful, you know the relationships that you have Become transactional for people, you know, they everybody wants Shit from you and when you don't give it to them. They fucking hate you. So like I just I'm just like Fuck it. I just won't let anybody come around me. Yeah, so now I just chill, dude And honestly, I fucking love it like it's not like I don't like it. I like it a lot So pour myself into our companies and doing the show and just keep to myself out here, man I'm not one of these fucking people, bro like I'm not one of them like one of these like Like I see all these people on the internet and they're out trying to you know, I don't know like I just don't I don't connect with it. You know trying to like play to like oh, I went here. I went there Here's my photo from here. Yeah, it's just not I'm not one of them dude. I just like my life and the reason I do this shit is Hopefully people get value out of it and You know, that's what it is. I think the difference there is I think a lot of people and we were talking about this earlier a lot of people I even think was traveling a lot of people are traveling for other people more than themselves Yeah, like they're going to a destination to get the Instagram or they're going there to get the picture as opposed to going somewhere They genuinely want to go. Yeah, and so I think we can talk about things to become transactional I think even travels become transactional for people like the whole reason I Yeah, I flew here to get that photo at that spot And it's like put it on my Instagram and like you didn't even and people are like oh, I love to travel on world travel It's like you're not really though. Yeah, you like when they all go to Greece and take a picture the exact same picture Fucking photo. Yeah, but I was gonna say though real quick before we move on if you like that gothic architecture You need to go to Edinburgh, Scotland. Yeah, that's just like that deep spire. Yeah, dark creepy looking shit Edinburgh, Scotland below the castle there walking those little cobblestone streets there is probably I think the coolest city I've ever been to Dude you would love Barcelona. Yeah, I've left scene like the cathedrals there. It's the same kind of look You see the Sungrotto La Familia. That's probably what it was Fuck dude. It's insane. We're just saying. Well, let's go. Let's go when when let's go to those concerts over there We talked about in Europe. Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking that was all 10. Yeah, that's fucking do that You just think you know I also want to go I've talked a lot of friends of mine that have traveled Well, it took a hundred years to build that building What the fuck? Yeah, there's an architect that has all kinds of buildings through Barcelona's name is Godine And they all they are all ridiculously cool Yeah, bro that thing is fucking massive. Yeah, there's a lot of this in Paris too some of the Look how many How many like spires it has this exactly we're talking about like imagine this now imagine this is your city Yeah, bro DJ. I'm not shit in you bro. I've been all over the world. That is the craziest. That is the craziest fucking building I've seen person. Yeah, it's fucking massive. It's the details insane It's I've never seen anything like it You said a hundred years to be old. Yeah And the thing is it's probably still constantly being worked on it is it is they have their other updating something They're fixing something they're adding their reinforcing That's what I'm saying like so I think in a good example What we're talking about here is do you remember when the Nordim could the Nordim Cathedral Cot fire Yes, do you remember how many people rallied to earn money for that building? Do you think anybody is gonna do that in one of these modern skyscrapers topples? No, no To build them they can fucking build another one. There's no pride. There's no there's no memory There's no attachment to it But you better believe if that's your city center and people start rioting and they're throwing Molotov cocktails and break People are gonna defend it people are gonna go out there and fucking yeah get violent on the streets just The you know the same way to defend something that but it's not gonna happen in these modern cities. Yeah Well, dude, I think a big part of the revitalization of this country Has to do with the legitimate architecture that we rebuild here because We have to I mean this is an intentional demoralization of of our country And I've heard Trump talk about it a few times where he's talking about building getting some of the money Going towards revitalization of some of the inner cities with like good architecture Um Hopefully someone follows through on that I could tell you if I was president, dude. That'd be a huge priority Even like I mean you cook downtown St. Louis has some beautiful buildings that have just been left to rot Yeah, if they were just enforced the law that'd be great might be all right. Yeah, well It's real shit man. Well, uh Kyle you want to do some creaking some some some cruising? Well, let's do it. I think that's what we do creaking too whatever you want man Let's get into it guys Uh, remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them linked there with that being said. Let's get into it first headline talk of the day Um, this one's uh catching a lot of eyeballs. It's diving to headline to born headline to born reads shocking moment tic-toker tells illegal immigrants how to invade American homes and invoked squatter rights As provocative video is viewed almost four million times provocative I see this I saw this. I have seen it. You seen it? Okay. Yesterday when I was actually on my plane and watched it flying in Let's dive into this a little bit. So a tic-toc influencer Is advising illegal immigrants on how to invade American homes and invoke squatter rights Making it difficult for them to be removed from properties Lionel Moreno who goes by at uh, Lito Official underscores 25 online and appears to be a Venezuelan migrant Has told undocumented immigrants that under us law If a house is not inhabited we can seize it He's referring to squatters rights or adverse possession laws a common law principle that allows an illegal inhabitant To acquire ownership of a property based on continuous occupation without the legal owners consent Moreno alleging he has friends who have already taken about seven homes argued the only way for migrants to not live in the streets or Be a public burden is to seize and invade abandoned properties Uh, the now viral video which has viewed uh been viewed almost four million times as prompted outrage from many social media users Some of claim Moreno is promoting terrorism Um, and an out calling on the FBI and Department of Homeland Security To action uh squatters right laws Uh, they exist in all 50 states and have sparked a crisis among across the nation uh quote serial squatters Are overtaking homes and helpless families booted out of their houses by crooks and uh are desperately turning into vigilantes to reclaim their homes Here's the video. It isn't Spanish Um, but we'll read the subtitles as it goes along My My people I have thought about invading a home in the United States now that I have became Aware of a law that exists If a house is not occupied we can take it over to peace Much as the law of taking over land of pies here in the United States I think that will be my next business That's a bad houses Our band and now Found some information Like my African friends They told me that seven homes that they have seven homes confiscated In the same goes You got to find the way around in the way around is now invading home now that we are homeless The only way we have And that's the only way we have And not be a public charge The law says that the house is abandoned The tyranny and the poor condition In the United States We can come and repair it Living it and if we can sell it Becrest Crazed What do you think about Um, so marano who's believed to live in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio with his partner and their infant daughter has a mast a following of more than 500,000 on tiktok by creating videos targeted at migrants The migrant influencer in a video posted four days ago is encouraging illegal immigrants to take over unoccupied homes Um Guys when we got on this Fuck this guy Um First of all, I don't think squatters rights should even exist I think that's just like an oxymoron You shouldn't have rights as a squatter for that and If I didn't see like the seriousness of his tone or his facial expressions I would almost think this was like satire like he was joking about how this is gonna be a business venture firm But you can tell you can tell when you see his face that he's serious about it um And I also find it funny and this is how I think a lot of people are gonna defend it is how he's saying we're gonna do this So we're not a public charge or it's almost like he's saying they're gonna do it to be helpful like oh We're not gonna be on the streets. We're gonna be helpful and live in a house It this whole thing is just problematic and you know, I I know Andy's gonna have something to say about this with people need to not stand for this shit Like you can't let this happen like the fact that people have been able to squat in someone's house in New York Or wherever it's been happening and the neighbors first of all the neighbor I knew someone was squatting in the house next to me that you know Was probably here doing a bunch of criminal shit or someone that you know I don't want next to where my kid lives I'd be over in that house myself that night kicking those people out I wouldn't wait for the police to do it I wouldn't wait for my neighbor to find someone to do it. I'd go help myself just because that's my community And I think it's kind of pathetic that it's been allowed to go on as long as it has yeah Oh, let's just get started That's the fact it's it's just getting started That's the point that has to be understood here I told you guys this is what was going to happen. I told you like two years ago This is what was going to happen Because it's already happened Okay, this isn't rocket science We can look at what's happened in other places in the world And tell what's going to happen here And when you look at what's happening in Europe and when you look at what's happened in some of the countries is South America El Salvador, Venezuela This is what they did And I said very clearly a number of years ago that if you don't stand up against this you Will go on vacation and you will come home and there will be somebody's living in your house that you can't get out And then I told you that the law would side with them And you guys call me fucking crazy Well Here we go Okay, and what's going to have to happen here is American people are going to have to legitimately stand up against these people And that's what they want that's what they're creating They're creating a situation where over the summer it's not going to be George Floyd this time It's going to be migrants and citizens and when you shoot a fucking migrant for being in your house They're going to arrest you and that's what's going to happen These people better be careful because real real talk Americans might have been docile and they might have been You know I there's there's a huge amount of Americans that have guns That are really kind of just waiting for the signal to do whatever needs to be done and once the law fully breaks down which it's going to and people are not concerned about being held accountable For standing up for themselves. There's going to be a literal fucking problem for these people and You know this guy getting on the internet and saying this shit if I'm being honest I think he's putting his own life in danger because if it got that viral and you know Just The way he said it and his cocky little fucking face and all this shit. Yeah, seeing his face makes it a lot more Make sure pissed yeah, and He's sitting here saying they're going to fucking take this and that come fucking get some dude That's my attitude with it come. I hope you do. I hope you come to my house and I hope you try to get some Do you think every state would side with the squad or though because I don't think I don't think what happened in every state Would it well, I mean every state has squad of rights Like they have every state like castle laws and stuff though, right? But and then that's what like it's all I'm gonna play devil's advocate here a little bit, right So like you know, you look at a city like St. Louis for example, right? You go over to the north side of St. Louis There are thousands of abandoned homes thousands of them, right? Now Obviously, we understand that the issue here is that the fact that these people don't belong in this country That's a side issue You know, but squad of rights they have existed in this country for a long time I'm not saying that it's right or wrong, but is there a certain degree that like you know We talk about taking you know responsibility and accountability for your life your community You know as a homeowner is somebody that's owning property and if you're not taking care of it What do you think it's gonna happen? Mm-hmm, you know what I'm saying? It's like I mean how do you guys like what's the flip side of this? You know I'm saying like if you're just letting this piece of property just sit there like yes in a perfect world You should be able to just let it sit there, but that's not the case, right? Like where's the accountability on the homeowner's at this point? Well, I could see I could see with the example where you're talking about St. Louis because those buildings are dilapidated and been left alone for 10 20 30 years, but like you know talking about a slated in New York for example Yeah, that was like a house she inherited that's in like a neighborhood that is not a dilapidated house Like that's the kind of shit that people do not stand for yeah I mean that's that's or like where was it in Oregon when someone went on vacation and came back and there was tense in the yard That's crazy these people Are fucking stealing they're committing violent crime. They're not supposed to be here They're not being held accountable to law. They're getting all the privileges that an American citizen should be getting that's they're not getting right okay Our veterans don't get treated like this our inner city communities don't get treated like this These people are having the red carpet rolled out for them and they are immune to any consequences for anything that they do and that's intentional It's intentional because what they're trying to do is bringing a new population of people because the current population of American citizens Does not believe or support the government right now so their their response is not hey let's fix our policies Their responses will fuck them will bring in more people and that's what they're doing and which we cannot handle Huh our country is no and these these leftists are gonna say well This is great for the city because they're maintaining the houses and they're doing this and they're doing that okay How are they gonna get the funds to fucking fix these houses how are they when we have Tyson chicken laying off American thousands of Americans to hire thousands of illegals because they can have cheaper fucking wages What like could we not understand the flip that's happening here and it's intentional They're trying to flip Americans into extreme homelessness poverty and replace the lowest class of Americans with these migrants Because the the poorest Americans typically vote Democrat and they're not voting Democrat anymore because they realized that the Democrats are full of shit So this is their solution and they're bringing these people are not the the Road scholars of these countries. They're not the humanitarians of these countries These are people who have been in fucking prison who Commit crimes that their own country is happy to fucking remove Okay, so You know I stand by do Americans are gonna have to stand up dude your ass. Yeah, listen dude Your ass is gonna have to stand on the line. That's it and it's not just one person It's not just a few persons. It's not oh well you first It's in our own neighborhoods. We're going to have to hold the line That's that's that's not an organized movement like people think it's an or they're waiting for an organized leader Movement to come along that they can join listen This is your responsibility in your neighborhood just like you said you would handle it in your community And to your point DJ I can understand okay, well, you know nobody's using these buildings well on somebody's balance sheet Those buildings are an equitable asset, okay, so You if you own yeah, if you own a hundred Rentals and half of them aren't Occupied and they get taken over by Venice Venezuelan migrants Do you deserve to lose that equity off your balance sheet because for people that don't belong here? No Or for anybody who even belongs here you see what I'm saying so dude I can understand you know People trying to justify it. Oh, but it's not right and it's not cool and um, it's people that haven't ever had to earn any of the Well, I think what we're gonna see I think what we're gonna who's been buying all the homes the last couple years Go to two main companies private equity black rock black rock, okay? Now I think what we're gonna see is we're gonna see black rock come out and say All those homes we bought We have a migrant program and they're all That and I think that's the purpose of why they've been buying all these houses Which means they're gonna put these fucking people potentially in your neighborhood as your neighbor on your fucking dime Because they're all gonna be on government assistance. They're all and by the way I saw this meme last night where somebody was making fun of actually I got it right here It was uh The headline was from Howard Dean and it said and it was MSNBC It said Biden is going to win election reasonably handling And people were laughing in the comments Well, he is going to win the election handling because between now and then he's gonna figure out a way to get all these people to vote Okay, and they're gonna vote for him Not passively not moderately But enthusiastically because their ass is on the line to be deported at a mass scale So we really think about what's going on here and you guys think the elections in the bag and you know The culture has changed and everybody know it hasn't because these people are importing people at numbers that are greater than what the numbers are for the other side so Americans are gonna have to stand up They're gonna have to Fucking make sure that these people are not allowed to vote They're gonna have to man the polls. They're gonna have to do all the shit that the other team does They're gonna have to ballot harvest. They're gonna have to work They're gonna have to make sure there's no cheating and that's gonna be a requirement And I don't know the conservatives will do that. I like the funny thing about all this is The people you're saying that are gonna support it and say yeah, but they're maintaining these homes are the same people complaining that they can't afford a home You know, you have this whole millennial generation and I'm part of that generation myself Where they're complaining about the price of housing What you're totally fine if someone's coming in taking a house when you've been busting your ass trying to you know Get out of an apartment your whole life like you shouldn't be okay with that. Yeah, and they're not gonna let you take a house Dude, I was we joke to my last night and you called me. I was like man I'm thinking about selling my place and just taking something. I hate paying them more. Yeah We got this But if this there's a person there's a there's a there's a there's a there. Yeah, DJ and I got it Yeah, if this I think if this happens in your neighborhood and you don't do anything about it You're just as much a part of the problem You know you are a part of the problem and if you stay silent about it you're part of the problem like at this point Time if you're silent about what's going on in this country You are part of the fucking problem. This wouldn't happen in like the 1950s. You know, it's wouldn't happen This wouldn't have happened four or five six years ago. I'm just saying like back then It was like, you know, you took out your neighbors trash for them. You helped your neighbor like it seemed like there's a real sense of community back Then that we've totally lost and I think social media is kind of create a lot of that failed failed community. Well that goes back to that goes back to The demoralization of the country. Yeah You know, yeah, I mean soon I'm saying they'll like if I have a good relation with my neighbors I talk with them, you know, I help them take the trash out when they're traveling I know look after the yard and so I would do this for them and I don't think a lot of neighborhoods have that anymore. No, no, I got some cool neighbors I know I know one of your neighbors. You're not a fan of there's there's there's there's They're most of them are really cool. Yeah, most of majority. Yeah But no, I think I think that's the real that's the real thing, you know, there's the with this whole situation, man It's like we have to get back to this concerted effort and intentional push of unity amongst Americans Right because that's the only way the shit is gonna get fixed. Yeah, this even goes back to where you're talking about architecture Like if you live in a neighborhood that was all beautiful Victorian homes and wasn't a bunch of cookie cutter looking little You know ship boxes and you saw someone come in and take one of these homes and start fucking it up You'd be like no that's such and such as home. That's that family's home like you'd feel a connection to that house I'll tell you their neighbor's name bro. Listen This is a time in history where American men are needed more than ever That's the truth This is the most important port I believe this is the most important time in our country's history I believe that and I believe that if we don't stand up and we don't speak up and we don't start getting our shit together Really fucking fast. We're gonna lose the country for real So do you guys understand if you want to really understand what's going on go find out How many european immigrants came between the year 1800 and the 1920s? To the United States and then go look at how many of these immigrants Fucking migrants came in the last four years. Okay. It's fucking in like a 10x multiple I think I've seen so where do you think? Where do you think this country is going to be in 20 or 30 years? Okay, like people don't understand this people are not thinking about this like These people have to be deported. They have to be deported. It's not it's not optional It's they have to go and that's just the reality otherwise the country is over in terms of any sort of European descent at all over the next fucking dude the birth rates down. Elon Musk talks about this all the time like There it's it's a it's a genocide over the course of time intentionally Well, and Elon also talks about you know, he's all four expediting like the legal path to citizenship You know he thinks that things because he himself is an immigrant. I think I think a good way of thinking him I think a good way thinking about this is like you know You have a concert venue for example you have 30,000 tickets by selling tickets You can control the flow into that concert and make sure only 30,000 people are there Which gives a better experience for everyone if you just announced you were having a concert didn't sell tickets And just let the doors open it would ruin the experience for every fucking person there Because a whole thing would be a pandemonium And I think I you know, I think looking at immigration that way is important because when it's done legally The flow is controlled. It's better for everyone. You know, what's going on where but right now It's just like this pandemonium where I mean you look like what happened at Woodstock 99 We're like didn't know what the fuck they were doing. They got too many people in that area It was disastrous people were dying. It was on fire and it was just it became like basically a ship box for three days Um, and that's kind of essentially what's happening now without this control Yeah, and I have a question you might know this you might not but with these squatters rights If you squat on a house Can you use that as a permanent residence to now like expedite your citizenship I'm not sure because it seems like something that certain places you can certainly use that to vote It seems like I was gonna it seems like that would be a path They are gonna come up with a way between now and election for these people all to vote People people don't think that's going to happen between now and that that's already put those That's 100% gonna happen 100% New York City Couple places in California. They've already put legislation down Like they probably so yeah, but dude like when I read the comments on that post They're all laughing at him like this is why this is why you fuckers lost and fucking 2020 And besides they stole it, but you know like they can they can only fudge so much And like here's what happens every time Conservative in common sense people and pro-America people get all riled up and patriotic and then they don't do shit They don't show up. They don't fucking do any of the shit these other people do They assume that they're gonna our steamroll and then they get beat And it's just like ever it's like sports when people think when you know a good team That thinks they're gonna run over the other team and the other team beats the shit out of them Like that's that's the problem with With the middle and the right and not only that they they don't work together They're look how many people argued over Trump and DeSantis so fucking passionately Even though they're on the same team right look at the way the conservative influencers consistently attack each other For who does more or who does what or how they do it like bro that's never gonna win anything That we're not gonna win that way Common sense will lose that way because what we're facing here Is a fight to the death DeLon tweeted this today. It was a tweet that he tweeted today. It says um It fucking says This is a battle to the death with the anti civil civilization Woke mine virus my positions are centrist secure borders safe and clean cities Don't bankrupt America with spending racism against any races wrong No sterilization below the age of consent is this right wing well according to them. It's far right wing But he's correct about that first statement that this is a fight to the death Because these people will not Halorate anything other than their narrative And I think they've proven that you know if you don't accept everything they say you're a bigot You're a racist you're a misogynist cancel you fire you ruin your reputation These people are communist and they intend to win and they're not fucking around and Americans think that can never happen here And it's happening right in front of their face and half of the fucking people are like Bro, you don't even know what communism is no you don't know what communism is You don't know what communism is because it doesn't look like communism until the fucking mass comes off And they tell you to face the fucking wall Okay, and if we look at all the things that are happening in this country with the migration invasion and the weaponization of the DOJ and People being held responsible like Daniel Penny for standing up in society How can society function without great men standing up for their community and being put in jail You see what I'm saying? So like all the pieces are in place for America to legitimately be conquered And unless people start coming together as Americans which we have been calling for on this show for years It's not black white left right Gay straight you are a fucking American and now we are facing a legitimate Invasion from people who are not a member of that and if you are on the team of the other team Then you are an enemy of America, bro That is just real shit and people need to come together They need to put their differences aside. They need to say hey, you know what you're right I don't agree with you necessarily politically or socially But this is our fucking shit and nobody's gonna take it And that's the attitude that Americans have to come to for us to fix what's going on here. Yeah, yeah That's real man guys jump it on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think Uh, with that being said, let's cruise some uh, and I saw this comment thought we'd go down the rabbit hole a little bit Really serious you guys thought about this comment this comment comes from at Kevin Lewis 91 51 he says Mike Tyson is a luminati. I guarantee he's got someone given him 18-year-old blood transfusions daily And he's going to be an animal and rip Jake Paul apart That's a troll comedy just fucking around I bet he's I bet he's beerbong an infant blood. Yeah He's eating fucking babies, which is kind of funny because during the fucking fight That one time I think it was when he fought a van der Holyfield and he bit his hero Yeah, yeah, I told him he went fucking crazy after the fight and he goes oh you should fucking children I remember that yeah, I'm saying that really oh fuck yeah, there's a book them saying it no Did he talk about like eating someone's balls to I don't know probably I eat your balls God part of that same rant or another rant he talks about even someone's balls listen I say you fucked some white boy in the ass. He said that one that was doing the interview. I mean he did go a jail Fucking it white boy. You love it as we say something to be effective that Well, I read today. They're trying to get this sanctioned as like a real fight in the state of Texas So hopefully that you know makes a less of an exhibition a more of an actual fight Always confusion with Mike Tyson who's standing by with Jim Gray Jim yeah Okay, thank you Steve Mike. Was that your shortest fight ever? I bet witness there's only one god and my homies blessed and people upon them is this profit I dedicate this fight to my brother Darabam who died. I'll be there to see you. I love you with all my heart All praise be to my children. I love you. Oh god. I'm man. What? Is this your shortest fight ever in any time? I'm a true professional ever. I'm a lecha Mida. Oh Maybe isn't I don't know man Yeah, yeah, Lenin fluid links. I'm coming for you Is it frustrating to train like you did and then have this is seven eight seconds? I only trained probably two weeks a three weeks for this fight. I had to bat him my best friend And I dedicated fight. I wasn't gonna fight. I dedicated to fight them. I was gonna rip his heart out I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion. There's ever been there's no one can stop me Links to the conqueror. No, I'm Alexander. He's no Alexander. I'm the best ever. There's never been anybody's I'm sunny listen. I'm Jack Dempsey. There's no one like my from their club. There's no one that can match me My style is in patchy with my defenses in pregnant. And I'm just from roach. I want your heart. I want to eat his children Praise be to a lot. I ain't nothing to joke. I ain't gonna fight that yeah at that time He definitely wasn't now. I think he was very much a savage at that point this career. Yeah, fuck me I don't know man. Oh, no Kevin listening. Maybe yeah, we talk about Tyson every time on here Like I think the first time I was on here is when Tyson had like a gun pulled on him on a rooftop at some comedy No, I remember that and we talked about that too. It feels like Tyson's always are like this. I don't know man I think you know Who said he's children I mean maybe he was being serious maybe yeah, maybe I don't know guys. We appreciate you guys coming Kevin everybody's illuminati man. Yeah, that's real just what's the bro you're doing the hand just I'm doing the hand stuff. Look how Andy's holding his hands. He's controlled opposition. The fuck out of here Fucking one guys. We appreciate you coming cool. Hey, we appreciate you guys coming. Thanks for being a real ass Fran let's get back to the cruise at number two. Bro, have you really like seeing how fucking far out there some of these people have gotten with this shit Oh some of this is wild bro some of this is wild but then some of that shit I'm like yeah, the show might have a dick. Wow You know I'm saying I know The problem with that though is you make the legitimate stuff like just get brush turn of the rug when you get too crazy and too deep And do these holes like it makes everything. It's actually real just part of the same, you know, just just bullshit Yeah, so all the real stuff gets ignored because like oh, that's you know, that's just part of this I mean, I'm not saying I don't think that shit's real. I mean, I think these motherfuckers do actually do that shit I think they I think they're into children. I think they fucking I think that a dream of chrome shit is probably real. I think it's a underground thing like dude There's so many celebrities that have come out and kind of given the same account you look at what Ryan Garcia is saying and like dude There's a whole bunch of celebrities that have been kicked out of Hollywood. They all have similar stories I think you got to look back as at Hunter S Thompson You know, because he originally wrote about that in the fear and loathing in Las Vegas I think it was like the first time a journey chrome was mentioned in like the mainstream was in that book And at the time Hunter S Thompson was a journalist and he was known as by like being a very brutally honest journalist I mean, he wrote that hell's angel by uh, you know, book that was you know kind of put him on the map And so he talked about journey chrome in fear and loathing in Las Vegas and a lot of people point to that is like him Being very honest about stuff he'd heard or seeing and because that's what he was known before he before he became like The gonzo character and like coked out of his mind and really lost himself You know last couple years of his life you couldn't understand a word that guy said he was so fucked up But for a while there who's a very legitimate and very honest straightforward journalist with what he wrote about Well, I mean if we're voting I'm voting. They probably do this shit. They probably do it Yeah, I'm saying like claims like the problem is you make claims about like you know Mike Tyson stuffing aluminum and audio jokes like this like you kind of you disparage like the reality of what it really is when you go that far Yeah, I think joking around that I think that's a I think I don't think that's a serious comment But you know, I do think I don't know that I don't think my ties is doing I don't think so either but there are some eyes doing it Mike Tyson did he still have all his money. That's true. Yeah That's true for real. That's true Guys let's get keep this cruise move. We got headline number two. I had them two reads No charges filed after New York City subway riders shot at passengers took cover And screamed there were babies on board Uh, let's dive into this. This is coming straight out of New York City coming out of the big apple This headline article reads a 36 year old man was shot with his own gun on a New York City subway Thursday as terrified Riders took cover Screamed that there were babies on board and begged for someone to open the train doors So they could get to safety while Brooklyn district attorney's office spokesperson orin Yineve On Friday said the shooting quote was shocking and deeply upsetting He added that quote at the stage evidence of self-defense precludes us from filing any criminal charges against the shooter So the incident on a northbound a train which was captured on video Comes on the heels of a string of violent crimes on the city subway system That prompted New York governor Kathy Halka to deploy a force of 1000 I'm including 750 national guard to increase security on the transit network Videos posted on social media show the unidentified 36 year old man Approaching a 32 year old passenger and getting into a verbal dispute The footage appears to show the 36 year old ranting and yelling and threatening to beat up the 32 year old Now you guys can tell this is obviously a shot who the 36 year old So the 36 year old is the aggressor, okay, so he got you the one with his gun. He hasn't got it So he started to pull shit and got shot he fucked around and finally fucking found out. All right. Here's the clip I So that's him starting really continues. Then there's the altercation. It gets going You You can hear the gun and hit the seat Oh Uh He's got his gun. His gun's his jacket. I believe I was like, I don't know who it is. Is she stabbed? She stabbed. I'm like, is she stabbed? No, this is where he starts screaming. There was blood. Okay, you can see him bleeding. Oh, yeah, he seemed bleeding right there on the backside. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. So the guy took his gun. Yeah, so charges have been dropped. There's all been ruled as of right now. It's self defense. But it did make me think about a different case that also happened on the New York City subway. And you actually alluded to it a little bit. The Daniel Penny situation. So this comes out literally right at the same time that, you know, the DA's office, the same DA's office. The charge Daniel Penny. His trial just got set for October 8th of this year. Farmerine Daniel Penny is quote, confident he'll beat the man slot of charges he faces for killing homeless man Jordan nearly on the New York City subway last May. His attorney told the post Wednesday as a Manhattan judge set the trial for October 8th. The proceedings will likely last about four weeks, although they could run as long as six Manhattan Supreme Court justice max Maxwell Wiley said during the hearing. Yeah, so I mean, I think I think I know what the difference is between these. Can I say it? Well, I was going to say it. Okay, you can say what you think, but I have a, I have an interesting one of them is brown. And the other one is not brown. Okay, that's one. See, I thought that. You know, the reason that. Chargers were pressed in this case with Daniel Penny is because they were able to find a nice picture of the person that makes him look so sweet and innocent. But you can see your point too. Yeah, that's the guy shot the guy. No, no, this is a shot Daniel. That's a homeless guy. Right. Daniel, yeah, well people don't really find a picture of you from my preschool or something. Then yeah, you're getting charges, bro. Now, bro, listen, this is the guy who just shot that guy is brown. Daniel Penny is white. And they're holding this guy in jail for the last, since last May. All the way through till October. And who knows how much longer after that. And that was he was standing up. For a bunch of people in the subway against this guy who was going fucking insane. The same shit that other guy was doing, right? Threatening people getting in their face, fucking with them. And he he stepped in as a man trying to protect the people on that train. And. If we create a society where good men go to jail for doing the right thing and protecting women and children and other citizens. We cannot have a functioning society. It's impossible. So. You know, it is what it is, man. Like the guy the guy is being held because it's okay to charge a white person and hold them right now. And the crowd in cities like New York and cities like St. Louis. Black people are not being held to the same standard. And that's just reality. So we have to get back to everybody, no matter what race they are. If they break the law, they are held accountable equally. And this kind of double standard only promotes more racial animosity between white people and black people. And that's intentional. And so it's very important for everybody out here to not buy into that artificial division that's happening and it's bullshit that Daniel Penny is is in there. 100%. You can't allow that to like make you see your fellow citizen in different way. We have to realize that we're being sucked into racial division very intentionally. It doesn't mean that what they're doing isn't happening though because it is happening. I mean aside from racial division to I think the whole. The real problem with this case is it makes. Men not want to stand up. It makes you afraid to do the right thing course. There's other men who do so we talk about people need to stand up for you know all the shit going on it makes you be like well look what they did to him. Yeah, it's very intentional because it makes you not want to act. Yeah. Well, and that's why that's why they've passed those laws to where now police can be held personally liable for something that happens on the job. I mean going back to that subway shooting though, I was honestly just surprised that any guy who wears a cross body bag was able to wrestle a gun away from someone. Yeah. I mean that that to me with shocking. Yeah, if I see a guy with the cross body back I'm like I can fuck that guy. He came up victorious so props to him. Yeah, I mean one of no man who's that guy. This is the guy that shot him. Oh, is he not brown? I would say he's not white. Yeah, no, he's not white. Well, I mean look dude. They're charging their these people that commit these crimes of smigrants. They're marking them as white people. They are doing that. Yeah, they are doing that man. It's just listen to sucks but you know. Here's the important thing. We say this all the time, especially when it comes to legal stuff. It's all about precedence. What is the precedence that's being set in this case? I see this and I hope that with this being set how it is that more people do see this and like, okay, well, it didn't happen to this guy. So maybe there is a chance of Glimmer. I don't know if the DA is office in New York City. You know, we are in a different environment than we were even a year ago. You know, I'm saying so I don't know man. This guy should not be in jail. Daniel Pindy should not be in jail. Yeah, he's keeping hold without bail and stuff. I'm not sure. I believe that he's in jail right now. Well, yeah, I think no, I think he did. I think there were some issues about them trying to deny him bail. Initially, I think he made out, but they raised it up so fucking absorbantly. But I think he ended up getting like a go from here. I don't, I'm not a, see if he can pull it up if he's in or out. But I know at first they were not trying to let him have bail at all. Bro, I mean, yeah. You know, yeah, that's fun. Dude, listen, here's the reality. If enough people stand up, there's nothing they can do. Where they're gonna do the rest to everybody. Right. It's time for people to stand up. It really is. Like if you see some fucking shit going down and you don't assert yourself, you're part of the problem. Well, that was the thing I was watching that video. I was trying to see if anyone ever tried to step in and break it up in that one. Guy, we're in a construction vest. He was trying to get in for a minute, but other than that, everyone else just cowered away. And that's very common on the subway system right now. From my understanding, I was talking to some friends that I have that still live in New York. I used to live in New York. And you know, one of my good friends, I was talking to those telling you about her last night. I mean, she's a New Yorker whole life and she's like, I don't ride the subway anymore. She's like, I used to always ride the subway. It's pretty critical to getting around New York. The subway is the backbone of that city for a lot of people. And it's at a state where people don't don't even ride anymore because there's so much shit like this going on. And you're locked in a box with someone. And it's it's bad. It's bad news. And like, you know, what we're saying about this other guy is you see someone stand up and get in trouble for it. Why the fuck is anyone else going to try? Yeah, see here Missouri, dude. What what happened is one of the miss one of us would have been had we would have had a gun. And that guy with the gun would have got shot. Well, it's the problem with New York and we talked about this. You can't even carry a pocket knife in New York. Yeah, that's crazy. You know, when I moved there, I had no idea. I grew up in Utah. I always had a pocket knife on me. It's just something like, you know, it's like a set of keys. You put a pocket knife in your pocket and you're never knowing you might need it to cut something. Or I just, I can start like a tool that I always had. I lived in New York for a year walking to my office every day with a buck knife in my pocket. And I had no idea that had I been busted with that. I would have been charged the concealed weapon. Until I read a story about a chef who had been gotten on the subway after work with his chef knives and got busted for it and did jail time for it. I had no idea. And that was one of the things that prompted me to leave New York to. I felt like once I learned that, I was like, wow, this. I don't like it in the city. I love New York a lot of reasons, but that to me was one of the reasons why I started, you know, looking to move out. Isn't that crazy though? The states or the cities with the strongest fucking weapon laws are also the states in the cities with the most amount of lalancron. Isn't that weird? Not really. I mean, it's like if you put a wolf in a in a henhouse, I mean, it's going to do it at once to do it. And there's no good wolves. Yeah. You take all the teeth out of the good wolves. Right. When you take the one sheep dog and then you punish it for defending the flock, you know. Dude, look, man, this is what's happening here. This is what J6 was about to you. J6 was about coming down so hard on the people that were there that no one wants to protest. No one wants to assemble. Nobody wants to do anything. It was a completely orchestrated event. Intentionally, the footage that comes out supports that claim. The denial of 25,000 troops that Trump requested supports that claim. The unavailability of the all the footage supports that claim. These people up there in Washington know what happened on J6. They just don't want to say it. The I'm talking about the Republicans now. They just don't want to say it because they're afraid of the backlash. Yeah. And that was about intimidating people into not protesting. It was to squash preemptively. Any sort of resistance they might have. Yep. And this Daniel Penny case. Is no different. This is a good opportunity for them to show everybody what happens when good men stand up and try to defend what's actually happening that is evil. And without that element in society, our society cannot function. And all of these middle upper class white women who do brunch that fucking champion all these causes, you know, feminism, no guns. You know, all that they're not they're going to they're going to be screaming when all this shit comes to a head and they're going to be saying this. We're all the good men. We're all the great men. Why are you men such pussies? Where are the men? They're going to say that over and over again just like they say right now. We're all the men to date. Well, nobody wants to date you because anytime someone gives you a compliment, it's harassment. Anytime someone does anything as a man, you guys go on the internet and fucking destroy them and men have figured out like fuck these bitches. That's what they figured out. Okay, so they don't want to open your door for me. Yeah, right. Like you guys have caused this. And for this to get corrected, women have to correct it. And so, dude, this this situation is going to lead to such violence and such destruction. And honestly, the rape and murder of many, many women because that's what's been happening in Europe. All right. And women are going to be screaming. They're going to say, where are the good men? Where are they? Where are they? Remember, you're the one that championed all the rights for these people. You're the one that's sumped for these people. You're the one that felt sorry for them. You're the one that said it was racist to hold people accountable. You're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Okay, so when this shit comes to your fucking brunch table and some dude follows you home and follows you in your house. And fucking sexually assaults you or steals your purse or beat your ass on the street because he wants your fucking handbag or corners you and does some shit to you. Just remember what you did before that happened because good men in America are willing to stand up. But we have been villainized and we have been neutered by the law and punish now because of these progressive far left policies that the little brunch crowd decides they're going to fucking champion every single day. And we can champion every single Sunday and Saturday with their mimosas. Yeah, that's real shit man. Guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our third and final hit on headline number three. Hello number three reads X NBC exec Mike sington, deletes tweet calling Baron trumps fair game on his 18th birthday amid wave of criticism. This fucking pedophile. Is that what he meant by that? Fuck you. I thought you met fair game like to attack you. Oh, no, you look back at his old tweets and he's talking about his craftman and how he's handsome and likes that he's tall. Oh, no shit. All right, well, let's go. Let's see this. Let's see this. A former NBC executive who caught Baron Trump fair game on his 18th birthday. Like, you know, he's starting to 18 now he's fair game. Right? Yeah, I've been watching him since he was a little kid. Right? No, he's fair game. I originally thought it was you thought Andy. I thought he was saying fair game like we can talk shit on him. That's what I thought. Until I looked into it and saw people pull his old tweets where he's constantly. No shit. And his looks talking about how tall he is like everything. Probably wants to get dick down by Baron. Pretty much. Well, he wants that red. Yeah. Red rocket. Hey, man. We got plenty of woodchipers people like this. That's what it needs, man. Yeah. But yes, he's through you. He deleted the tweet after being accused of inciting attacks against the former president's son. Even this article is not even painted how it really is. But Mike Stanton enraged followers yesterday with the post with many reporting him to ask him because their pedophiles too, bro. Right. Elon Musk and Twitter. He has since removed it, but is yet to apologize. Instead, telling Newsweek, quote, I posted he was fair game. Now, meaning as an adult, he's fair game for criticism from the press. So someone pointed out to me, fair game could mean fair game to be harmed in the booty. He says, I don't wish physical harm on anyone. So I took it down. I'll listen to the comments and criticism I received in BC where Sincton where says he worked for 30 years is yet to public comments. And this is the Tweety put down. Baron Trump turns 18 today. He's fair game now. And this is the guy who said it. This is my fuck. This is Mike. Why they all look the same, bro? I don't know, man. He likes booty. I'll tell you that dude. He likes little kids. He likes booty. He likes booty. Charlie Kirk. Hold on. I want to see these tweets of him with his little kid tweets. We got that. I can pull him up. Let me see. Man, this guy don't look right. Does he? No, he doesn't. He's a creep, man. Look at that. Like if you saw that, dude, you would know he's into some weird ass shit. Yeah. So this is Mike Sincton. This isn't this is equal six of 2022. He says, quote, heterosexual grooming, a set of practices and expectations based on a child's assigned gender at birth, which promotes the formation of a romantic relationship with the opposite sets. It begins at a very young age and is often aggressively carried out. Why would you post that? Well, first because you're mad that you're homosexual. Okay. He's upset that he's that he's almost, let me explain something to you, bro. There's this thing. It's called a fucking penis. Okay. And there's this other thing. It's called a vagina. Those things go together naturally from nature. And when the penis squirts out a little juice, it fucking makes a little baby and it comes out the vagina. All right. This is this is this is not grooming. This is the this is called the way it fucking works. It's a bee. Yeah, bro. So like, let's like what the fuck? Like there's no heterosexual grooming. It's called the way it is. Is that your birds? So so who grooms all the animals in nature? I was just going to say don't the groom your dog. Like who grooms all the deer and who grooms all the bears and who grooms all the fucking gorillas? Like who's out there grooming these motherfuckers to be heterosexual? This might be the dumbest tweet I've ever fucking seen in my life. This is the good stuff. See a creepy. This is from this is from March 20th of 2018, Mike Sington tweets out first son, Baron Trump celebrates his 12th birthday today. Let's take a look back. Just like I mean, just weird fucking pictures, bro. Weird, weird pictures. I says, quote, everyone's talking about how tall Baron Trump is here, tawing over Mike Pence for his family sake, only wish him the best that he be gay and ends up marrying a guy from a shit hole country and they buy a nice home together in Mexico. Dude, what's wrong with this motherfucker? What's, whatever man. I mean, put him on the woodchipper list. You know, so, so, so, so, Charlie Kirk called him disgusting. Yeah. You know, other people were, you know, in the comments, sounds like incitement to me. What a horrible thing to say. Somebody else was even like, even tried, he's like, I'm a Democrat and this is bad. And they said, this is bad and I'm not even a Republican. So I mean, I mean, people have been on it, man. But the Baron is fucking tall. I think he's like six seven, dude. That's all of you. Six six. Oh, damn. He's fucking tall. Yeah, he is. Trump's a big dude, bro. He towers over Trump's like six four, right? I think he's like six three. Six three. Yeah. Yeah. Trump's a big dude, bro. He's like 280. The thing about, I think the thing about this that I find very hypocritical is, you know, for a long time, a lot of men have been like, you know, the hustler barely legal club, barely legal girls that are 18 and women have always been like, that's disgusting. That's creepy. And most guys will get it's creepy. Why aren't any of them saying that about this guy at this time, you know? You know, Mike's happy right now. You know, do listen. These people are afraid. They've been bullied for the last 15, 20 years. Pretty hard. What I'm saying, if it was someone saying that about someone's daughter just turned 18, they'd be on them all over the day. Well, I don't think I don't think that I think people are reading it how we read it. Yeah, I think so. I think he's happy we're reading it like, yeah, everybody ready. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I meant. Yeah. Yeah. It is a little bit of a weird situation where the intentions can be mistrude. I would check that dude's fucking hard drive, bro. Check all of them, bro. Check this fucking hard drive. There's those accounts that we follow on Instagram that like chased the pedophiles down. Yeah, what is J in them? Yeah, yeah. Fucking. That's the one I was told you about. I think I'm from Pinterest. Yeah, absolutely. Look, dude, those guys are exposing to the world just how common this shit is. This is very common. These people are everywhere. They're in your grocery store. They're in your gym. They're in the places that you go every day. I saw one where it was a school principal. Yeah. And so, like, dude, you guys with kids, you need to be very careful. And you men out there when this shit starts to happen, you need to handle it. Mm-hmm. Got to handle it. Is that a, is that Trump towers? That's a lot of fucking gold. That's got to be. Trump likes that shit. That old school gold, man. That's a lot of gold. He likes that, he likes that, that royalty type. Well, that's what made him like, I mean, prior to him being a president, he was huge in the hip hop community. Yeah. Everyone had a rapper. They talked about like Donald Trump. Well, I'll tell you this. I don't hate on it at all. I think, I mean, it's like his own style. I've said a little old school for me, but it's fucking badass. Yeah. Do you see that trying to take Trump Tyler from them now? Yeah. That's what he made in the T-Share James. T-Share paper work today. Yeah. That's trying to, because you know, we can't pay half a billion dollars. I thought he was a billionaire. First, nobody, like, who's going to have that liquid like nobody? Well, actually, there's a few guys, right? There's a few. But, but I mean, they, you know their names. Right. You know what I'm saying? Nobody walks around with hundreds. It just shows you how financially illiterate the average person is. Because I saw like hundreds of those comments. Yeah. I'm like, what the fuck are you guys doing? What are you here? I'll start to check. What the fuck do you guys think? Do you think, even if I had it, I'm not fucking paying it. Hold on. Do you think that this dude just walks around with fuck, like they think that eight, nine billion, this guy, they think this guy has nine billion dollars in cash or whatever the fuck he's worth, right? Like they don't like the general public do nowadays is so like misinformed about just basic life skills. Every person who has wealth, their wealth is usually tied up in equity and opportunity that grow faster than the interest rate that they can get on other sorts of investments. Trump is a smart man. He has his money working for him. Regular people don't fucking think about it like that. They think, oh, you're a millionaire. You got a million dollars in cash or you're a billionaire. You got a billion dollars in cash. That's not how it works, bro. Almost all these dudes, their net worth is tied up in their assets that can then be borrowed against or sold to create the liquid that you think that they have. And what Trump is doing, he's saying, I'm not fucking selling shit to pay you motherfuckers. That's what he's saying. And it's being, it's being played as he doesn't have any money. And it's not the truth. What he's saying is I ain't selling shit. Fuck you. That's what he's saying. It's not even the general public. I saw, I think it was a representative for the state of California. I'm not sure it was, it was someone in Congress who said, I know. No Trump's not a billionaire because I can do math referring to this kind of thing. I saw that Ted Luz, who that was. Yeah, it was he like representative of California. He was a Congressman for California. What math was he doing? So you know, like, you know, if he was a billionaire, you'd have the cash. But then Mark Cuban, they do. It's got golf courses worth almost a billion dollars. What I've said, but what I thought was cool though is Mark Cuban stepped in and Cuban and Trump hate each other. Mark Cuban stepped in and said, listen, you don't know anything about finances. Let me explain you how finances work as a billionaire. And Mark Cuban basically said what you just said. Attacking this Congressman. So it's not just the general public. It's like anyone in opposition that is making up this lie about finances. I actually thought it was really cool of Cuban to step in and explain to him all the quiddity that sets work. I think Mark Cuban is off on a lot of his opinions politically. But generally like as a dude, I've always been a fan. You know what I'm saying? As a business guy and what he's done. Bro, he's bad ass. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, he's smart too. So like he would be an interesting guy for us to talk to because like, why are you gay? No, first question. Yeah. No, I just think I just think because dude, you know, when people are that intelligent, they usually have logical points to base their opinions in. And you know, he's his opinions. There's just still wrong. They're just agree with mine. So they're wrong. Yeah, Cuban. Yeah, Cuban. Let's do it. Yeah. Let's fucking do it. Look, I've always liked him. Nice. He seems like my most short. Yeah. I love his fucking passion for his shit that he does. It's bad ass. It's admirable. But you know, and I think as I think this brings up another point is that we have to get back to being cool with people that we may not agree with everything they fucking say politically. Like, you know, I do this so funny. I get these DMs sometimes that are like, fuck you and your fucking opinions and you're a fucking idiot blah, blah, blah. And I'll just write them back. And I'll be like, well, I mean, everybody's entitled to their opinion, man, this is America. Like if that's really what you feel, like that's cool. And they're like, well, bro, like I didn't, I didn't think you were actually going to message me. Also, you just be a big. Yeah. And then, you know, and usually they're like, oh, dude, you know, I was having a bad day or whatever. Like, you know, it's kind of like customer service these days. Like customer service has gotten so bad that when people want something done, they actually call the company and motherfuck them up and down right out the gate because they think that's what it takes to get something done because everything else is so bad. And when we think about like the discourse that's happening in society, it's been so bad for so long that people automatically go to the attack, you know, and sink and kill their entire lives mode instead of actually having a conversation based around why you think what you think. Yeah. And then, you know, I'm just going to say, okay, well, I disagree with you, bro, but I mean, we still drink a beer. You know what I'm saying? But here's the problem. Bro, a lot of people on that left side are unwilling to do that. They can't do it. Yeah. They're not willing to do it, dude. And you know why they're not willing to do it? Because most of their points are not based on actual fact and they have a hard time backing them up. That's why they go immediately to name calling. You know what I'm saying? When you go to, when someone goes to name calling on you, you've won the argument. They've lost you. That's right. 100%. I don't know if you had this experience growing up, but some of my best friends, I didn't like initially, like friends that I have from high school, like in high school, we didn't like each other. I mean, I even have friends that like we got fights. Yeah. And then we ended up being like, wait a minute, we actually, we're really similar. And those are the friendships that I've had for 20 plus years. And if I had had that mentality back then of like, I'm never going to talk to this person, I would have missed out on some really good friendships that I've had because of that. Yeah. I totally get that. Yeah. It's real shit, man. Well, guys, that was our third and final headline. Let's get to our last segment of the show. We get thumbs up or dumb as fuck. That's where we bring our article up. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, watch the incredible moment and Oklahoma City Thunder fan wins $20,000 from stunning half court shot on the night his team record, 119 to 107 win over the jazz. What's that record for? Record win is what they're, how they're meant for that to be read. You're a court of it. Okay. Like, you record a win. I want to be record. I think is how you know, I think it's saying like record win. I think it's. I think it's the last one. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. I think it's really good. It's really good, man. I think it's a great thing to see you. I don't know. No, I don't. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not going to make it. I think it's, I think it's a good thing to see. Okay, I don't know. I think you're going to be record. win. I think it's written by dumbass. I think so too. I mean, look at this right word. Yeah. Low, low chiano. Sounds Italian. I know. That sounds Brazilian. Yeah. Maybe we're done. Maybe it's all the all Missourian. Yeah. That's right. Um, so Oklahoma City Thunder fan left Pay Com Center with $20,000 after making a half court shot on Wednesday night during the game between the Thunder and the Utah Jazz 18 year old Cody Hoover was selected to attempt the big money shot courtesy of mid first bank, who, uh, Hoover marched onto the Cinecourt wearing a white Thunder Jersey. A crowd cheered on the Tierney teenager as Oklahoma City mascot Rumble grabbed him by the head to wish him good luck. Um, as the drum roll commence, Hoover took one dribble and a few steps towards the Cinecourt before pulling up for the shot. The ball kissed the glass before going in the hoop as the Oklahoma City crowd erupted in celebration, uh, who were celebrated with the storm chasers by the OKC logo as he received his massive check. Arena MC Malcolm Tubbs noted that Hoover was the first fan to convert a half court shot this season. Here's the clip. Moments ago, we've been waiting a long time for one of these to go. Oh, it's just a special night. And that's just a start. I'll tell you one thing. That's a pretty good goodness. That's a good hand for me. You take it. How much did he win? Sent this crowd on its feet. Cody Hoover Hoover getting a big time, big time bucket. That was pretty cool. He's going to throw that all in crypto and move it tomorrow. Well, Cuner, let's say good thing we're in the duck contest. Yeah, well, that's probably true. They're they're some truth to stereotypes, man. I can accept the white people's stereotypes. It's just y'all can't accept the other ones. What? White people can't jump. I mean, very rarely. I mean, didn't they make a whole movie to prove that wrong? Didn't they make a whole movie about that? Is there a movie called White Man Count? Yeah, it's Woody Harrelson. Yeah, did he jump? Isn't it Wesley Snipes in there too? I think so. I would have never seen it. But didn't they prove that they could? Like, it wasn't. I can't remember my dad needs to watch it when I was like, yeah, he does, right? What? We call my dad to watch it. Is it the dude who's won the duck contest the last couple of years? Why, dude? Yeah, that's why I thought he's pretty bad ass too. So maybe there is exceptions outliers. That guy's not fucking dunking. Oh, yeah. Hey, we're good job though. That's awesome. Don't waste it all in crypto. Yeah, we got on this thumbs up. Oh, obviously. I mean, I don't know. That's like no contest. I think crypto's, I think crypto's maybe a little bit better than going down just being real. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. Sweet. Well, that was our thumbs up, man. Guys, Andy Kyle. That's all I got. Yeah. All right, guys. Thanks, Kyle. Thanks for having me back. It's always good to see you. We got a special episode with Kyle coming up. You guys are going to like what we do. We do. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Black leather cow. It's not that. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Casting room. It's not it's it's a you don't know why they're calling big reds. Not this. See, that's one of them stereotypes is not true. Yeah. All right. It's good. I'm tall. That's all there is to it. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Should have a show.
