overwhelming it's been very very very inspiring to me personally that so many people are committed to getting better and just being better examples you know we're moving into one of what I think will

man it's cool um but yeah got a couple of the a couple of things happen uh let's check them out uh do you see that uh Biden had to be reminded that he likes ice cream yeah so hell on reads Biden has to be reminded by Jill that ice cream is his favorite food during rare interview shocking yeah they gave him some softball questions um this New York post article reads he only takes soft serve questions uh president Biden stumbled in his latest interview when asked about what food he likes uh with first lady Joe Biden prodding the 81 year old commander in chief to remind him he enjoys ice cream here's a video I'm curious what sort of holiday foods have you been enjoying over the last few days well I've been eating everything is putting front me but I mean pasta which I love eating a lot of chicken chicken Parmesan I'm eating all all Italian foods basically ice cream and ice cream chocolate chip ice cream why do they look so weird um what the fuck is she weird that's what I want to know I better cost a lot though oh I guarantee you a cost of taxpayer money yep absolutely and I bet you a couple bunch of kids made it yeah in China did you see the green day stuff I didn't see it but I heard about it yeah that's what's off on but I mean like it's not really shocking like they they've always yeah I mean it's always been that way they've always been that like I mean it's not like the first time everybody's making a big deal out of it I just think it's funny how all these rock and roll people think that like people give a fuck what they think mm-hmm like you're out of touch bro you've been famous your whole life you're richest fuck shut the fuck up play your fucking music be lucky that we've listened to your shit yeah no shit here's the clip from that though how old are they old he's in his 50s yeah anyway the point is is yeah like dude the guy's fucking four foot eleven yeah you know you've been around forever bro like just sing the fucking song yeah the days of these Hollywood and rock and roll people coming out like like like they think they're being revolutionary like there's nothing revolutionary about being on the side of the establishment there's nothing revolutionary about being on the on the side of big media big pharma corrupt governments across the world the world economic forum the globalist movement there's nothing punk or rock yeah these guys are paid these people are employed by record companies who have certain agendas and they are told that they can say certain things and those things are not in favor with the public anymore and they continue to come out and it's show how out of touch they are most people who listen to rock and who listen to heavy shit they are not with this shit like these people are here listen to rage against the machine like rage against the machine has entered its greatest era of all time and they don't even know it and they're too stupid to capitalize on it like all of their lyrics apply to the progressive left to communism to what's going on in the world and then these people come out and stand with those same people and make some look like clowns and it exposes that they were never really about that shit anyway it was just it was just marketing dude if rage against the machine came out right now and said dude we're with the people like this is crazy they'd be the biggest band in the fucking world but they won't do it because there are a bunch of fucking sellouts yeah which sucks because I've always been a huge fan of their music I still am a huge fan of their music but because the lyrics apply man they apply it's funny because when I first started listening to them back in the 90s these their lyrics were for the the left right the left has always been the punk the rebellious fuck the man yes and now they are the man and they're still saying this shit and it makes them look stupid that's wild man man so that was New Year's yeah that was New Year's let's uh we'll take a cruise yeah let's do it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures links articles videos go to Andy for seller.com can find them there with that being said headline number one headline number one graphics are good you've been working on stuff I like it earning this keep that's right great headline number one headline number one reads Jeffrey Epstein's friend list Elaine Maxwell lawsuit holds clue to names about to be made public so nearly 200 names that have previously been redacted from court documents in a lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein's former lover and accomplished Elaine Maxwell will soon be made public after a federal judge in New York ordered their unceiling last month so US district judge Loretta Preska issued a 51 page order explaining her reasoning on whether to unseal or continue to redact the names of about 180 John and Jane Does giving some clues as to who they might be now some of the names were previously known there were other means despite having been withheld from the public's eye in the lawsuit many had publicly known ties to Epstein others on the list include as alleged victims who were taken to his private island in the US Virgin Islands or one of his mansions in New York City in Florida now Virginia Gouffrey and Epstein accuser who said he trafficked her as a minor in the early 2000s sued Maxwell in 2015 the party settled out of court in 2017 Epstein had relations relationships with numerous influential figures from politicians including one president some prime ministers to Hollywood stars leading academics in the UK's prince Andrew whom Gouffrey also sued now one of the names have been has been unmasked as John Doe 36 and um it's Bill Clinton Bill Clinton to be unmasked as Doe 36 and identifying more than 50 times in Jeffrey Epstein Doc Bump Doc Dump it's not shocking no dude anybody who's been paying attention to this for any amount of time knows this it's not shocking so but here's what I'm confused about them are they calling him Bill Clinton in the document now or they still call him Doe 36 and he will be so that name will no longer be like it'll be called Bill Clinton yeah okay and is that true for the other names too do you know yeah so so that's the interesting thing right so um like I this little excerpt from ABC right so what what the judge did I'll read this so so according to the procedure established by judge Preska attorneys for each of the Does were offered a preview of the court files containing their name before determinations were made about unceiling the records each person was afforded an opportunity to argue for keeping the records sealed Clinton's legal team after reviewing the excerpts did not lodge any objections to the publications of the documents according to Preska's order last month so the judge gave every single one of those jandos and jandos an opportunity to say hey make a case keep my stuff blacked out and redacted they didn't they didn't object to it which is like weird in in and of itself like why don't you care if your names gonna be like wouldn't you want because nothing happens to no matter what they didn't they don't care that's the see that that's like I'm like okay well like this is just a pure power ego yeah do something about it this how I'm seeing it man because like that's what they do when they take when they when they take the mask when the evil villain takes their own mask off that's them telling you like yeah it's mean there's nothing you're gonna do about it yeah that's what's been happening there's no accountability for anybody in any of these situations that have happened over the last 20 30 years in government these people have been allowed to do whatever they want at our expense to ruin our countries to do whatever they think they need to do and they don't have to they don't have to be held accountable for anything none of the people who were participated in covid which was all wrong and all lies and all propaganda for the most part have been held accountable or even begun to be held accountable like there's these people are doing whatever they want with no accountability and they they don't give a shit if you see it or know it or whatever they don't care yeah in fact they still have the gall to come on tv and tell you that you know how you should live your life and how you should vote yeah yeah i mean and the Clinton House has been quiet no comment has been made from the Clintons at all about any of this stuff and the list was supposed to drop today there's still a lot of opportunity for it to drop you know at the time of the record it hasn't been out yet but Bill Clinton has definitely been unnamed unmasked is what they're calling it I mean what does it matter if the list drops or not like everybody knows who these people are right nobody nothing's happened to them nothing's going to happen to them and let's the people rise up and make something happen to them demand something yeah that's it like that like people keep saying nothing's going to happen that's accurate as long as you keep saying nothing's going to happen and you think that someone's going to write in and hold all these people accountable we have to hold them accountable so when we get on the internet and we black pill all this shit and say yeah well they're going to get away with it or yeah why don't you instead start calling for accountability why don't we as people start calling for accountability like of course they're not going to be held accountable because are there friends going to hang them are there friends going to put them in jail for the next 50 years are there friends going to you know hold them accountable for crimes against humanity are they going to do that no they're not going to do that their friends are going to say well if we do that to them they're going to say they're going to tell what we did too so everybody protects each other and that's what's going on here and it's us versus them us the peasants versus them the the power brokers of the world because they've decided in their head that they can choose for for all of us yeah it's fucked up man there's a lot of that going on to this you know letting the friends off we'll get to that here in a minute um yeah guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think was just surprising for you was it expected what do you guys think let us know down in the comments uh with that being said let's keep cruising uh these people are not afraid do not that to me that's just a question why would they be afraid what would they be afraid of right this is why accountability has to be had because there's been such a long time since any accountability has been exercised that none of these people globally are afraid to do anything to any one of us or any group of us this is this is for all governments in the world no leader who is tyrannical who has you know like when was the last time one of these people were lined up against the wall and fucking shot when was the last time one of these people were put in prison when was the last time a group of these people were hung when was the last time that people were held accountable in any way that would instill any kind of respect or fear for us the people there is none we're not we the people are failing our obligation to hold these people accountable which is defined in the constitution of the United States of America we are not upholding our duty no these people should be held accountable and it should be the demand of the people for the crimes that they've committed when you look at what Hillary Clinton's done just her by herself take away the Epstein stuff take away everything dude and you look at her allegedly which when I say allegedly I mean 99% of the fucking evidence says that she created that out of thin air Christopher Steele's document on the steel dossier that's that's that's okay see find her it's been proven by multiple agencies that this is a factual statement that that document was made up and off of that document they created the Trump Ressa collusion narrative and for eight years now they have divided America based around this narrative which is was made up on their part to make Trump look like a traitor they attacked him through the media they propagated all this division around this thing they said he was in Russia getting pissed on by prostitutes and colluding with Vladimir Putin etc etc etc etc etc you know peach terms vice row failed okay and the thing is is that they made it up they just made it up because they didn't win the way they wanted to and so they made living hell for the rest of America because they didn't get their way think of all the division that's been created out of this think of all the the identity politics division think of all the all the cancel culture think of all the negative shit that's happened since 2016 when she made up that document for political reasons and these people walk around with smiles on their faces in their Martha's vineyards home living these ultra fucking elite rich lifestyles shoving it down our fucking throats making our life living hell that to me that should be punishable by severe consequences to the point where we understand that you shouldn't do that yeah when we talk about covid and we talk about what was done during covid by the media by Fauci and by international organizations like the w-h-o and the w-e-f and all this is like a thousand to two thousand very elite people who have created these narratives that literally closed millions of businesses ruin millions of lives created a situation where two years of school was missed for kids at critical ages and their development that are now all fucked up okay like people were killed because they were denied effective therapeutics because if you talked about ivermectin or you talked about hydroxychloroquine or you talked about the vaccine you were booted off the internet you were de-plat how many people died because you couldn't talk about ivermectin so that they could maintain a state of emergency through covid how many people how many people how many people have now had ill side effects or myocarditis because they forced the fucking vaccine on them forced it to keep their jobs in 2021 how many people millions of fucking people bro and this is all you can't even talk about it but now we have all these people and this is how this is how weak the common sense conservative side of the population is they're so fucking weak dude is disgusting when people die who are young like they in you go read the comments no one's saying obviously it's the fucking vaccine people are saying whoa i wonder what it is because they're too afraid to even say what it is died suddenly yeah like we all know what's happening we all understand what's been going on there's tons of insurance data that shows that death rates are at a ridiculous high amount especially with stillborn births and fucking myocarditis and kids and sudden deaths like all of these things have been covered up and aren't talked about and the whole population of common sense americans and people of the world are still like they're like passively talking about it it's like well i clearly obvious what that is and like they won't even like you won't even say it like dude and if we as a people won't even say this shit out loud how the fuck are we gonna get from here to accountability right you see what i'm saying you can't like bro i come on a podcast in front of the whole world this entire time and said all the shit that nobody wants to say i'm still fucking here motherfuckers and you're afraid to say fuck anything and we wonder why there's no accountability that's why because people are fucking cowards sorry it is what it is you know how many people tell me they won't share the show because it's controversial well if you won't share a show or make a statement because it's controversial we'll never get to accountability for the people who have done the things that they've done it'll never happen anyway yeah so we'll see man guys see us tell us down in the comments what you guys think on this topic with that being said let's keep moving um let's create some comments let's do it this comment comes from Elaine Lee 1234 she says whoa whoa whoa wait a second here long time listening and i agree with 90% of what you guys say but Andy says quote we have to eliminate people from voting who do not contribute if you're a white suburban housewife who doesn't have their own tax return guess what no fucking vote in quote you're assuming being a housewife has no economic value who is taking care of the kids so the breadwinner can be out there winning bread you should rethink this one Andy yeah i read this comment i rethought it no fucking vote what oh yes i rethought it yep yep all right let's get back on to the crew look real real talk okay i'm i'm being an asshole because it was a appropriate opportunity let's be real you have to take it okay i have to take it there you have to take it it is what it is i love you Elaine all right we're all good um i think you make a fair case for the argument i'm open i'm open to i'm open to differing opinions i think this is a valuable opinion and i think you know if if your husband let's say you have a married household and your husband files a tax return then you guys can combine your phone look at it this way like is it your vote anyway aren't you telling this motherfucker what to vote for that's a fact i mean most of these men can't even tie their own fucking shoes like asking their wife if it's okay i mean aren't you really don't you really tell them how to vote let's be real well i'm looking at this way you can still vote on the grocery shop you can vote on the vote all right all right she can vote on our peanut butter jelly sandwich contest all right listen real real shit really real no real shit no vote Charmin or god now no listen real talk i think this is a fair point i think if you're a married household and you're a one-income family and you're on the tax return this you guys can both vote yeah for sure i think that's fair i think it's fair but i am gonna tease you about it because it's just teed up man i think i think you know i think she i think first of all you don't agree with 90 percent of what we say if you only agree with 90 percent you still wouldn't be here because the shit that you disagree would be so bad you say fuck those guys yeah you're a 99 percent or this was the one time you didn't agree and you made a good point so i'll allow you to vote yeah let's vote on if she should vote all right should she vote i say yes i say she should get a vote is it just me and you okay guys get a vote yes okay we got unanimous yeses here except i said no you said no i said no what do you say z-shon do women get the vote in India yeah okay all they do but isn't that the problems in India that's why that's why you left no here real real talk it's just too good i think she makes a good point and it's a great final serious answer if you're a married couple and it's a one-income household and you're taking care of the kids i think you should vote i think that's a good contribution of america i think i think she makes an excellent point real talk we can joke about it all we want but it's a good point and i'm glad she pointed out yeah all right well there you go again yeah all right let's keep this cruise moving headlined up to bro it's just so easy we can i mean listen you can't lie in shit up like that okay listen i i probably go back to it i want i want to correct my if that's so i'm sure she quoted me that's what's it first of all you got to understand i speak very loosely okay so sometimes i may not speak exactly what i mean but here's what i mean when i say this what i mean are the brunchers yeah the brunchers i mean the brunchers i don't i don't i don't actually mean white suburban housewife i mean i mean white suburban bruncher housewife that's what i fucking mean man yeah like i mean if you're actually like working the house you don't say you're doing the shit taking care yeah for sure okay because that is actually very valuable yeah absolutely because you're just going to fucking brunch on fucking Sundays and getting wine drunk if you don't have any kids and you're married to a dude who's got a job and you don't have any kids no vote no vote you gotta have kids to have to vote i like that that's a good rule that's a good rule because now you are contributing to the future of america yeah so you have a say i think she makes a great point make sure you're raising those little bad motherfuckers too yeah listen i'm not i'm not against saying when i'm wrong and and i was obviously talking there was just misquoted 90% yeah she clearly just fucked up what i said you gotta do a gavin on this one bro yeah that's not what i said no yes that's exactly what i said it is true because it's true oh man oh i'm glad she said that i love it i listen i'm i'm reasonable human being i think that's a reasonable point and i think she's right yeah so you know i'm making keep the vote for now the rest you motherfuckers no votes i love it guys just keep this cruise moving we got headlined and the number two reads justice department covering for deep state by not charging sam bankman freed another shocker for the guys listen we're starting we're starting 2024 off on a great great great way guys yeah um the justice department has been accused by multiple sources for covering for the deep state by not holding a second trial against disgraced former ftseo sand bankman freed for his allegedly unlawful political donations and bribery of foreign officials the new york post revealed Saturday um federal prosecutors said on friday that they will not hold a second trial against bankman freed claiming there was a public interest in a resolution to the bankman freed case the prosecutors also said that quote much of the evidence that would be offered in a second trial was already offered in the first trial and can be considered by the court at the defendant's march 2024 sentencing the officials added quote given that practical reality and the strongest public interest in a prompt resolution of this matter the government and tends to proceed to sentencing on the counts for which the defendant was convicted at trial a representative tim bershet of tenac on friday said the trial will not allow the american people to know more about which politicians tried to influence um quote so we don't know which politicians he bribed or whose campaign uh campaigns he influenced uh that collective sigh of relief you are hearing is from the deep state bershet wrote uh crypto law founder john deaton wrote the doj has shown again that it is not an independent agency who is the attorney general protecting uh turning point USA found a charlie kirk set quote uh the spf case became too high profile for the doj to completely ignore but they made sure laundering one hundred million of customers money uh it's a schumer biting the McConnell and other dark money groups would never blow back on the elite trump faces seven hundred years in federal prison but america's uniparty cabal just gave themselves a get out of jail free cart you're witnessing dc corruption in real time um yeah so uh they're they're basically dropping six charges against them um now again he donated about a hundred million dollars during the 2022 midterms point tens of millions into dark money groups with customer funds um and some of these groups they were linked to senate leaders like michael connell chuck schumer um maxine waters here's a video of her blowing him a kiss i mean you love this guy hmm anyway we got on this well to be clear like what people have to understand when they say giving customer customer customers funds customers bought ftx and then the money which it so often does with these cryptos exchanges and coins has to go somewhere and it just went away into these politicians pockets his lifestyle right so a lot of people don't understand this they don't understand i sell you a crypto coin which is nothing it doesn't exist physically it's nothing yeah i sell you some air you give me ten thousand dollars right okay and when i asked these crypto people where does that ten thousand dollars go they have such a hard time defining where it goes well in this case because it goes somewhere it has to go somewhere and we see that it goes somewhere by all the motherfuckers who are getting found uh caught doing this some of which have been literally killed unalived okay it's the greatest scam ever for for scammers because they're saying here's this thing that doesn't exist give me your money and then they turn around and do whatever they want with their money and this guy had billions of dollars at his disposal so what's he do does what a dumbass would do with billions of dollars in his disposal he spends it all on himself and then starts making himself the fucking man by giving all this money to these groups so he's taking money that was supposed to be held to fund the exchange and giving it away to these politicians and he thought the whole time that these politicians would never prosecute him because of the money that he was giving and that he would be allowed to continue to operate that's what he's not what people are not understanding is this was an implied deal between him and them and they were in on it and by them not allowing this trial to happen they are making it impossible for the evidence to be discovered to show that this was the arrangement the arrangement was I'm sure there are texts and conversations and all kinds of information meetings and that are documented that would come to surface that said basically give us the money and we'll make sure you never go to jail and so now these people are like well fuck this guy you know he's going to jail no matter what there's not any can do about it we're not gonna let that stuff come out so we're just not gonna prosecute this other case and what Charlie Kirk is saying is correct I don't agree with everything Charlie Kirk says or everything his organization says or does but he's 100% correct when he said what he said there well I mean and do his the other part too if all of this comes out I mean no where the money went who it went to and the fact that it was all illegal that money has to go back yeah and they they already spent that fucking money yeah bro so it's like okay so like I mean you give this is just this is just the tip of the corruption that people don't understand the bigger corruption scandal that's happened over the last three years is the printing of trillions of dollars and then the sending of aid to Ukraine and then the redistribution of funds from Ukraine back into these political packs and these individual politicians now that's the big corruption that's direct stealing from the taxpayers of the United States of America which where's that evidence and when's that gonna come out right and the reason that's not coming out is because that's the way they've always done it and the reason that we're seeing this massive amount of inflation in my opinion is that they understand that the collapse of the dollar is likely imminent and that there will be a transition to a digital currency or a digital standard and they understand that we are in the last days of American dollars as we know it so what would you do if you knew that the plan was to end the American dollar and bring in something else well here's what I would do if I were them and in their position I would print as much money as I can I would send it out over there I would funnel it back to myself and then I would buy beachfront properties like Nancy Pelosi did for $25 million in Florida when she says that global warming is going to swallow up the entire fucking eastern and west coast okay like people are so dumb they don't understand the fucking game here they don't see the show they're printing money because they're going to end the dollar they're going to collapse the dollars to hyperinflation transition to a digital currency they're printing the money they're then sending the money over there little zalinsky gets to keep part of it and he gets to buy some yachts and some big houses and all this shit the rest of it comes back to political packs or individual people that are in the government which they're all in on all the people voting for it are receiving back those people are taking the money buying assets that will bridge from this monetary system to the next if you own a piece of land or let's say gold or some sort of asset you can bridge the gap between the collapse of the dollar and the new currency then you sell the new asset on the new currency and you're rich in the new currency get it yep this is what they're doing yeah this is what Eric right and sat here and explained to us this is what Eric Schmidt sat here and explained to us this is what the fucking do it this is how they do it man yes and that's the bigger scam yeah this is just hey we did something yeah looks look dude our government is so far beyond corrupt of what most people understand is corrupt most people understand it's a country club good old boy these people are work most people understand that they don't understand it's a legitimate criminal organization that is stealing your fucking taxpayer your tax dollars and forcing you into poverty to pay that tax so they can fucking steal it like literally yep and they put it in this weird coded language yes you don't speak yes and they funnel it through the hospital follow they hit make all these bills and that's only one way they do it the other ways they do it is they make all these bills these these bills with you know that say infrastructure plan and then in the infrastructure plan they have um there's a 3000 page bill yeah yeah with all kinds of other shit and all kinds of other shit that sent out took for the budget who do they hire to do that work oh they hire companies that they own or own interest in or their buddies come to listen this is why I say that we as American citizens are literal slaves because we work our fucking asses off to have our money legitimately stolen from us from people that we fucking elect to serve us this is legitimately what's happening and most people are clueless to it and if you say it they fucking kill you or they put you in jail or they fucking ruin you so you know it's insane it's insane dude it's insane guys jump in on this conversation let us throw down in the comments what you guys think let us know without the immediate set man let's keep our crews moving we got our third and final headline headline number three and then number three reads Mike DeWine defends vetoing ban on gender procedures for minors JD vans slams his reasoning this is great I saw this is great yeah all right yep so uh Senator JD vans of Ohio blasted governor Mike DeWine Friday after the governor defended his veto of a bill that would ban gender procedures on minors and prevent boys from competing in girl sports the bill hb 68 vetoed by DeWine on Friday with ban would ban transgender procedures on minors such as double mastectomies on girls who identify as boys and other genital procedures for children with gender dysphoria it would also prohibit biological boys from competing in girl sports across the state DeWine said at a press conference following his decisions of veto the legislation that if the bill were to become law the government would be encroaching on parents rights here's the quick video ultimately I believe this is about protecting human life many parents have told me that their child would not have survived would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from one of Ohio's children's hospitals I've also been told by those who are now grown adults that but for this care they would have taken their life when they were teenagers parents are making decisions about the most precious thing in their life their child and none of us none of us should underestimate the gravity and difficulty of those decisions so vant slam DeWine's reasoning saying that the governor pointing to parents rights to make medical decisions for their children is simply using a slogan to defend his veto here's his official tweet jettie vant said quote this is a slogan not a justification there are many things the law rightfully says no one including parents may do to children this slogan also ignores the extraordinary pressure from interest groups and big former to green light poorly understood irreversible procedures I'm extremely disappointed in the governor's decision and hope it's overwritten now he didn't there's no way he vetoed this he's republican governor right he's typically should be in line with you know normalcy right but it can't just be because of parents rights that he vetoed this right like that could it be something else like could it like 40 thousand dollars something like that yeah yeah like like from the hospitals to do the surgeries yeah see yeah I got eyes everywhere it's insane yeah yeah Mike DeWine took 40 thousand three hundred dollars from Ohio hospitals that perform child sex changes before vetoing bill to protect kids from the practice this is how it works this is how it works so after a high-o governor with Mike DeWine veto legislation that would have been banned sex changes from minors a new report revealed that he has received thousands and campaign donations from hospitals that conduct or support those procedures according to the daily caller from 2018 to 2023 DeWine received 40 thousand dollars 40 40 thousand three hundred total from the Ohio Children's Hospital Association or OCHA Cincinnati's Children and Nationwide Children's Hospital and ProMedica Children's Hospital this is the list of tweets here parker Thayer he says Mike DeWine just vetoed a bill that would have protected children from irreversible general and hormonal mutilation the main entity opposing House Bill 68 seems to have been the Ohio's Children's Hospital Association this wouldn't be Mike's first time backing down to the OCHA oh and would you look at that though Ohio Children's Hospital Association has given DeWine $20,000 how nice of him to veto the bill that would have cost quote gender affirming children hospitals millions of dollars they make that mean because they're projecting that this movement here is going to be a billion dollar industry it's multi billion hundreds of billions dollars and this bill would have lost a lot of money for these hospitals and you know it's crazy Donald Trump because I believe he was once endorsed by Trump Trump came out and the statement he posted to truth social he said quote DeWine has fallen to the radical left no wonder he gets loudly booed in Ohio every time I introduce him at rallies but I won't be introducing him anymore I'm finished with this quote stiff one quote what was he thinking the bill would have stopped child mutilation and prevented men from playing in women's sports legislature well hopefully overturned do it fast anyway we got on this well first of all you know Trump got interviewed by Megan Kelley and couldn't say if he believed that there were only two genders clearly but okay so let's let's clarify that all right that should be pointed out yeah he stumbled and he hemmed in hot and he wouldn't answer the question say that's right you know at least ramaswami says the fucking truth he says this is a mental illness that should be treated like a mental illness and if we want to talk about true gender affirming care gender affirming care will be looking at a child who is too young to vote too young to get a tattoo too young to drink too young to get a joint military and look at them and say you're not a woman you're a little boy and that's that that's gender that's a firm in gender and the fact that we are in 2024 now and we are talking about allowing parents to make decisions to irreversibly mutilate their own children before their children or even have a mature brain is insane it's not mental illness it's criminal okay it's criminal to allow your child to make a decision to cut off their breasts or take irreversible puberty blockers or hormones the science isn't even there is no real science behind this anyway like just for the long term yes like it's just total backyard pharma guesswork let's just load them with a bunch of estrogen and see what the fuck happens yeah this is why you got dill and milvaney crying his eyes out every fucking day like there is no this is experimental shit and if we want to talk about the oh the that my fucking kid said they were going to kill themselves if they didn't cut off their weener um how how many kids say that shit about not being able to go out on the weekend right when they're grounded how many kids say that because you uh took their internet away how many let's look at the actual date let's look at the data of the actual suicide rate for trans people in general let's look at the suicide rate for detransition chance trans people okay let's start talking about some real data not some catchy slogans or some one off hypothetical I would have done this had this not happened there's a lot of people just to his point who say you know what uh I'm gonna kill myself now because I cut off my penis and and or I cut my breasts off and have my uterus removed and I can't live as a woman those people are coming out saying that they're going to kill themselves so who who's more valid the little kid that doesn't know shit or the person who's actually been through it who says you know what this is the worst thing that ever happened to me these people consulted me twice I was 14 years old or 16 years old I didn't know what I was doing and here I am with no uterus and no breasts and I can't change it and I can't go back and my life is fucking ruined so whose opinion is more valid a kid who doesn't know any better who's going to throw a tantrum about fucking literally anything getting grounded getting the internet taken away I'm gonna kill myself how many of you parents have fucking had your kids say some crazy shit like that when you've had to stand up and hold the line on them on something okay so the don't might do I and you're a fucking pussy bitch and you're complacent listen you're complacent in this and and what is going to go down in history as one of the most disgusting predatory criminal and moral errors of human history before to go this is Vimar Republic 2.0 all right this has already happened you're gonna live in shame for the rest of your life you could have made a stand for humanity you could have made a stand for what's right and you chose not to now if people when they're 18 years old which I still think should be illegal but if we're gonna say that they're an adult then if they want to have those procedures then I'm not one to stand in their way I still think it's not okay I still think it's fucked up I still think most of those people are gonna end up fucked up mentally yeah okay ultimately this comes down to weak parents who justify their kids actions who look at their kids as friends and not actually as little bit of humans that they have to raise and teach and correct and steer from doing the wrong thing which is very uncomfortable sometimes now I don't have any kids but I've raised a lot of other people's kids over my last 25 years in business and I've had to be a hard-ass sometimes and really piss some people off and sometimes they leave my company sometimes they say Andy fuck you but you know what they end up doing years later they come back and they say you know what they say thank you they say bro thank you for fucking telling me the truth thank you I'm sorry I was that way almost every single time that eventually happens and that's what being a parent or being a big brother or being a leader or being a role model is about and you just cemented your legacy as a fucking disgusting human being that's going to go down in history as one of the people who stood for literally one of the most damaging times in human history and that's that and honestly 40 gram man listen he's a in my opinion he in my opinion that man should be in jail for making that decision I agree anybody who does these procedures anybody who does any of this shit should eventually like this should all be corrected they should all go to fucking jail doctors that perform the shit this is wrong it's fucking wrong that's that's how I feel about it yeah it's insane man guys tell us what you guys think jump down to the comments now now now now I want to say this if you're a do you know who Jeffrey star is yeah Jeffrey star is a very famous trans person he disagrees with this shit right what I've seen okay like leave the kids alone I don't have a problem with transgender people if you want to live your life as the opposite gender as a grown adult dude I don't care and I don't care if you want to fuck him I don't care what you want to do I don't care the reason you think everybody cares is because you run around everywhere in society and all you talk about is your sexuality in your gender and you think that's the leading edge of every single person's life okay so this hate that they say they get is self imposed by acting like a ridiculous human being they're creating it correct it's not transphobia it's you being an asshole yeah okay and you forcing people to like like we talked about this like we saw that everybody saw the Delta Airlines clip yeah do we cover that on show that guy deserves a race okay I don't know if we cover that but there was this Delta Airlines clip this employee where this guy had his phone now this is what they always do with their fucking phones like bro you pull your phone out like that when me I'm gonna shove it up your fucking ass okay they pull out their phone and they start saying some ridiculous shit you misgendered me no you misgendered you you motherfucker like that's what the fuck the guy should say like you're misgendering you I'm pretty sure I'm getting it right sir yeah like this that's my biggest problem dude the shit's not even convincing no they're forcing you to make believe this is the problem I have with it dude yeah you're asking me to deny what I know to be true to myself for you hold on yeah if we deny what we know to be true to ourselves does our belief in ourselves and our confidence in our self go up or down do you think it goes down it goes down because you are you are violating what you know to be true by even admitting it so what you're asking me to do is something that is in violation of what I know to be true and you're forcing it on me okay so I'm not going to play that game because it doesn't it's not you some harmless polite shit you're asking me to lie so that you can celebrate that's not okay and then secondly what I'm doing by lying to you about this is I'm telling you that if you throw a big enough tantrum that you can get your way with anywhere in life which is why you are the way you are because most people will fucking bend for that I'm one of the ones that won't and I hope the people that listen to the show are the ones that won't because the only way that we're ever going to get a ground to calling this what it actually is which is a mental illness is by not continuing to play the game with these people now if you want to live as a trans person and you want to you want to call yourself a different name I'll even call you the other name like but like you could go live your life and all this shit stay away from my kids you know leave me to fuck alone like don't fucking try to impose all this shit on me and judge me for how I believe and I won't judge you for how you believe but the whole problem is is that these that's not good enough for these people these people want to embarrass and they want to get people fired and they want to ruin people's businesses and ruin people's lives by forcing them to adopt something that we all know every single fucking human knows this governor knows everybody knows is not true it's not true it's not true it is not true that a grown man with a set of balls and a fucking dick is a woman that is not true if you go to other cultures and you go to these tribes in the middle of Africa Matt Walsh did this he went to Africa and asked like they said what they laughed they couldn't comprehend and dude what we have to we have to come to terms here bro is that this is part of the demoralization process of a society this is a communist tactic to remove the truth from society and it's already been done before if you go look at what's happened in 1930s Germany at Vimar Republic that's W I W not Vy okay it's a W like Volkswagen yeah go fucking google it and fucking look up what they did this is nothing new this is what they did back then they did this back then and it's to remove the truth if we cannot if we cannot tell the truth about what a man or a woman actually is what can we tell the truth about it's the most fundamental truth out there it is the most fundamental truth that's why it's so attacked and they leverage people who are mentally ill who are lonely who are confused by internet doctrination or school indoctrination or trends or what's cool like dude this is this is this is pure fucking insanity of what's happening here and people are legitimately being mutilated because no one will stand up and say it for what it is very few people will and this guy just I mean I it's he's on the wrong side of the history books yeah forever yeah because this will get corrected this will not this will not continue to be this way no for 40 grand since I listen a lot of people do it for free a lot of people go along with it because they think they're being polite yeah I'm sorry dude it's if you want to do it and that's how you want to live I listen problem is the shit's not even convincing man like that's the problem like that at least make it look good no single poor like it's hard to fucking tail hold on tight hold on but the thing is bro but like these dudes bro like they're not trying it the less convincing it is the more effective it is because if it were convincing you would be more likely to go along with it yeah so the less convincing it is the more effective it is into more demoralization because you're understanding that this is clearly a fucking man yeah understand that's deep it's like them taking the mask off saying I know I have a dick but I'm a woman call me a woman if you don't you're a big it no I'm not I'm just a normal dude from 2001 yeah right that's a penis yes and you're in the pool fuck out guys settle to you guys think jump in on this conversation down in the comments let's know I was that being said when there was out there people people say that too they say I'm anti trans no I'm not I'm anti little kids getting mutilated I'm anti look hold on I'm anti little kids getting injected with hormones I'm anti little kids that aren't old enough to get attacked to or get breast implants deciding to get their breasts removed I'm anti little kid becoming the victim of some fucking mental case mom who doesn't have an actual identity who wants to brag to her friends that she has trans kids I'm anti letting little kids make irreversible decisions around their future which used to be the normalcy in America every that's why there's a rule about drinking that's why there's a rule about voting that's why there's a rule about getting tattoos that's why there's a rule about serving in the military every 12 year old boy in the fucking planet when I was 12 would have loved to join the military but guess what they're not allowed to can't do it but they're allowed to cut off their fucking dicks now that's fine you see what I'm saying like bro this is this is this is one of the most dangerous disgusting immoral weapons and and by you sympathizing with it that you're you're part of the problem okay that's real shit and like dude that doesn't make you anti trans when someone just as 18 years old and they want to go have a a general reassignment surgery and that's what they want to live with their whole life and they want to have complications of be unhealthy and half issues and surgeries after surgery listen that's your choice yeah I can't dictate that for you but you're but not the the human brain doesn't even fully develop into kids are like 25 years old bro yeah so like it's absurd shit and like I'm sorry I'm just not I'm not someone who can I don't know like I just I I don't I don't this is probably why I've had a more difficult life than I needed to have but I've never been able to just go along with shit like when I was in school or kicked out of class all the time because I'm like that's bullshit you know what I'm saying like I and everybody knows it man that's a problem yeah and nobody will say it because we don't have fucking balls to say it bro you guys cut those off too you know shit dude it's just it it's it's I can't this is a heartline to say yeah listen we're allowing children to cut off their breasts because they think they're a man we're allowing boys to cut off their penis and have a whole created in them that they have you're looked into this what has to happen for them to like maintain this oh bro it's like they have to like stretch it open there's all kinds of shit they get sick they have to have multiple they get multiple infection like there's this is not like a beautiful thing you know and this is why when you go on the internet and try to google it you can't find any fucking pictures of it they're very hard to find because it's so fucking awful to see if people would actually take the time and I have to seek out images of post transition surgery like what you get when you're done you would rethink your fucking opinion on this yeah yeah that's insane man guys tell us what you guys think if they had a picture of it of both if they had a picture of a manufactured penis and a manufacturer vagina and people had to look at it and then ask them right to their face do you think that's okay 100% of people would say no yeah 100% and if it would be if it was 99% you know to have these surgeries you need to be able to watch a full surgery you know I'm saying like watch a video of it go through like you gotta see it listen man they're okay we're gonna have we're gonna have this kind of surgery doesn't matter how old you are doesn't matter if you're 25 doesn't matter if you're 35 doesn't matter if you're 50 automatic three-year wait time three years got away for three years I like it give them the time to think bro talk to any of the kids in school bro talk to the kids in school kids in high school will tell you that this is no different than like when I was in school or you were in school and there was like a trend happening yeah like there's kids that don't have any friends and all of a sudden they say I'm non-binary and they're popular like this is a social everybody's talking about it right why they're talking yes dude this is yeah there's so much to consider here and it's so the implications are so permanent and so damaging it's just sad dude yeah true shit man well guys let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring a headline up we talk about it to get one of those two options and so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads lost dog is safely rescued after it survived alone in the woods for more than six years holy shit yeah man well fucking thug man uh 12-year-old Patadale Terrier survived for over six years it will go up for adoption soon so a dog that lived on its own in the woods for about six and a half years is now being cared for in an animal rescue and eventually it will be adopted into a loving home the dog name Rose was first reported by a person living near the village of Crawley down in West Sussex England in late November the lost dog recovery UK South wrote in a December 11th Facebook post the person who spotted Rose quote stop the traffic let the dog disappear into the woodland and knew not to follow and just returned a sap to leave food said lost dog recovery UK South lost dog recovery UK South is a nonprofit group funded by donations and run by volunteers it told Fox News Digital the concerned citizen was told by someone living in Crawley down that people in the area were aware of the dog and that she was frequently reported as being found um quote she was set to stray and be fed by people uh said lost dog recovery UK South the individual whom lost dog said was slightly perplexed but still very concerned at the notion of a dog living in the woods reached out to the organization with the discovery of the animal uh quote realizing it could just have been an own dog allowed to roam situation the camera was taken over and food left anyway until more information could be gathered uh the little dog was on camera at 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. the first night three times the next night and by the third day already appeared to be waiting for dinner time watching us park and walk up to the camera site um the group eventually learned that Rose was fed by local residents who thought that she uh quote she should be left alone and she was in good condition um so apparently they found the owners um uh but unfortunately Rose's original owners are unable to take her back into their home the owners were located but quote there are circumstances have dramatically changed since 2017 um they are thrilled that she's safe and unhurt and of course sad that they're unable to take her back wrote lost dog recovery UK South so she'll be going to a rescue who can give her what she needs and care for in her old age here Rose that's fucking bullshit those people put that dog out because they couldn't fucking handle it like a lot of people do you think so that's sad as fuck yeah that poor dog had a family and fucking lived in the woods for six fucking years on its own because a bunch of shitty humans fucking abandoned it I fucking hate people bro yeah I fucking hate them like the fact that you mother fuckers do that shit is fucking disgusting like you you fucking give your dogs up to fucking shelters and you abandon them and leave them in your houses and act like they're not a part of your fucking family like that dog fucking thinks that those people I guarantee you that dog saw those people it fucking go crazy be so happy it would love them and they just fucking tell me I don't like I wanted like if it was like a genuine case like a lost dog you know no people are bullshit yeah that's sad as fuck it's a cute little dog is a cute dog and it deserves better than that that's not dogs are dogs require a companionship and I know they're wild animals and shit but they've been domesticated over hundreds of years thousands of years no it's just fucking I fucking pisses me off it thums up for the dog and you know the people who are taking care of it now it looks super happy yeah just you already dude we heard the story a thousand times people like here in St. Louis dude people have to move or they can't afford their dog they drive it out to the country and just let it fucking go or they fucking let it leave it in their house when they move and just like leave it there like my dad taught me a long time ago dude he used to always say he always used to always say this to us he said if you're good to dogs and you're good to animals good things will happen to you and I believe that no that's real I believe that if you're good to animals I I believe the good things happen to you to me that's a it's a great indicator of just character yeah 100 and like if my dogs don't like you yeah I'm probably not gonna like you yeah it's because the dogs are also great judges of character when it comes to people most of the time well people are just shit yeah like whatever happens over the next year whatever fucking punishment the earth is about to receive for the degeneracy we deserve it not everybody deserves it but as a collective we do we deserve it you know the fact that we have adults that are willing to stand by and let kids have their penises cut off and and actually advocate for it and and then and then fucking saying and then good people say nothing like whatever's coming our way bro as humanity we deserve it you know we don't we lack the backbone to stand up for ourselves to fight for ourselves to stand up for things that are right anymore we can't even speak truth without fear of losing our social media clout or getting people offended like whatever dude like we're gonna keep talking about it and make a fun of it but the reality is is I've come to terms that whatever happens to the people and whatever fucking punishment we get dulled upon us it's it's well deserved so guys any that's all I got yeah don't be a hoe on bank road can't fold does it know here's shot case clout clout
