Let's get to our first headline man We got a lot to cover here headline number one Got a lot of more and reads send a detect proves CNN hosts clash sharply over voter fraud accepting election results Quote ridiculous question Now this is an interesting thing and I'll say this man. I watch this interview and this Caitlin Collins lady from CNN Might be she the one with the caterpillar eyebrows. I think so. Yeah, this lady here. She looks real mean That's her I Cannot nobody likes her. She's mean as fuck. She is a fucking asshole. Yeah, and she thinks she's smarter than everybody She hosted one of the debates or something. She's a town hall. I remember that. Yeah, she had mean face on all day He told her that too. He's like he's like you're such a nasty person. You could tell. Yeah, you could tell Yeah, she's she's a a class grade a Bruncher. Yeah, no doubt. She's the she's the king of brunchers King dangling of brunchers. That's right. But I'm not literal to you. Yes, so her and tech crews has this little he did a shame on CNN He went on there. Send it to tech crews out of Texas Clashed sharply with CNN host Caitlin Collins on Wednesday over questions about voter fraud and whether he would pledge to accept The 2024 election results accusing her of not holding prominent Democrats to the same standard Quote, I think that's actually a ridiculous question crew said to Collins who noted the Texas senator objected to certifying the 2020 election results on January 6th 2021 quote you ever ask a Democrat that Collins responded quote of course Before crews pushed back and asked quote what Democrat Quote I know I know I've been down this road many times Collins respond it you cannot compare the two situations what we We have talked about that we have seen the audio of that when they protested on the Senate floor But have you ever had a sitting president who refused to facilitate the peaceful transition of power Crews pushed back again and said they did have a peaceful transfer of power between Donald Trump and Joe Biden Before arguing the Democrats objected to the 2016 presidential elections Trump had repeatedly claimed the 2020 election was illegitimate and is facing federal election interference charges related to the January 6th Capitol riot in addition to state election interference charges in Georgia Crews took exceptions to Collins's lines of questioning in a Testy exchange with the anchor Says quote so you're asking will you promise no matter what to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens Crews said and that would be an absurd thing to claim like we have an entire election law system that people challenge elections Elections get overturned voter fraud gets proven that happens all the time and the media engages in this weird game Post Donald Trump that you insist no voter fraud has ever existed She asked him again if he would accept the results regardless of who wins in 2024 He says simply says look if the Democrats win I will accept the result But I'm not going to ignore fraud regardless of the result crew said Collins at one point claimed there was no voter fraud at all Before crews challenged her on making such a blanket assessment Quote you're saying zero voter fraud occurred crew said quote nothing that would have changed the outcome of the election Collins said okay, but that's a different statement crews just reply here's a quick little clip here man because this is this is interesting Any journal and my question it was the media was CNN that relentlessly pushed Relentlessly pushed that propaganda and by the way never Never there was no widespread fraud in the election that voter fraud doesn't exist And anyone who says it does is wearing a tinfoil hat that is propaganda and by the way You never ask Hillary Clinton this you never asked Stacy Abrams this you never ask out Gorgeous every one of them with all the Republicans who won real legitimate I haven't had any of them in my show will talk to them But I don't remember there being a president who was refusing to turn over the transition of power and facilitated it and Trump didn't either I'm 24 you did not answer let me say a final Let me say a final Where they have it come thank you very much Senator Paul and all red has an either he ought to come to your show Senator Ted Cruz now answer that question Thank you very much much more on that interview and what we touched on earlier Of course you heard the news story about the latest Supreme Court justice We talked about justice Alito there. There is more news on that tonight back. She's a bitch I mean, dude This is typical what these people do you know when they don't when they can't win an argument They either go straight to name calling or they cut you off they talk over you they stop the segment. This is this is intellectual Legitimate retardation. Yeah, okay, and and that's That's what it is. Yeah, okay, like when you lose an argument and you start calling people names You're a fucking intellectual dumb fuck you lose right there they're done and when you when you get to a point where you have to cut someone off and say I'm sorry What a time what a time what a time This is all they can do Yeah, man, it shouldn't be to nobody's surprise That's see it's prime time ratings have hit a 33 year low. It should be no surprise. I'm the since 1991 The disgrace cable channel Drew just 83,000 viewers From the ages of 25 to 54 during a week of May 13th through 19th from 8 p.m. To 11 p.m. So we talk about prime time viewership 83,000 people. That's it That's it. There's more people to listen to this fucking podcast. That's my life. Yeah, by a lot. Yeah, that's fucking facts You know, and so it should be no surprise But I mean why would they want to listen because everything that they fucking spew is a fucking lie Everything here's a here's a list and I'll let you read this off Yeah, let's start at the top the Russia collusion hoax made up hands up don't shoot hoax made up Jesse small ad hoax bullshit proven in court Coveington KKK kids hoax Very fine people hoax. We know that's bullshit. All you gotta do is watch the whole clip seven hour gap hoax. What's that one? That was the Anyway, Russia bounties hoax trump trashes troops hoax Police been killed at mostly peaceful January six protest hoax total lie written house hoax Eating while black hoax And Border agents whipping illegal hoax nascar news hoax The Georgia Jim Crow 2.0 hoax Trump assaulted secret service agents and grabbed the steering wheel of the beast hoax MAGA assaulted Paul Pelosi hoax COVID lab leak theory is racist hoax hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation hoax Joe Biden will never ban gas stoves hoax COVID deaths are overcounted as a conspiracy theory hoax mass graves of native children in Canada hoax The Trump killed all the fish hoax That's a new one to me. I remember though Trump told people to drink bleach hoax The mass hospital hoax if re-elected Trump will execute people hoax Well, fuck dude. I Don't want that one to be a hoax Well, the hoax was saying that that's what he was saying. Oh, and it was never true. He never he just never officially said it Environmental hoaxes all of them the alpha bank hoax libs of tiktok murdered non-barry binary teen hoax The Aaron Rogers sandy hook truther hoax. Some of these are new to me the blood bath hoax Um, yeah, but here's the thing outside of all of those the Hamas hospital hoax What what are they saying that they didn't blow up hospitals That that did happen Uh, that that did happen. Oh, this and real quick the seven hour gap hoax That was the one where they tried to say that Donald Trump had the White House deletes seven hours of fucking phone call records The hide stuff which was never true. No, what what they actually was delete 12,000 hours of video footage from January 6 and then only release a little bit of it and then when they released a little bit of it to appease the outcry They showed people legitimately Being pulled from the crowd fake arrest and then let go because it was our three letter agencies instigating what happened Every single one of these things I'm familiar with And they are all 100% hoax slash truth That they lied about these things except that Hamas hospital hoax They did blow up Hamas hospitals so um Yeah And remember it all started with russia collusion back in 2016 which has literally divided our country created so much animosity created so much division created so much Um resentment and most people that don't like Donald Trump still think that's true They still think he's a Russian asset like did the amount of people that believe this shit That believe all of this shit is unbelievable so And all you gotta do is look under the hood a little bit Yeah, now I'm checking on my Hamas hospital hoax thing Yeah, they were talking about the atrocity propaganda shit that was going on. Yeah, but they did blow up hospitals Why no, that's undeniable. Yeah Um Yeah, so you know there's no surprise at CNN's tanking it is what it is Um, you know, and I think the only thing that saves CNN even with the 83,000 and that may not even be fully accurate I don't know But it's the fact that there's one common name that they keep in their fucking mouths all the time Trump is Trump Cuz they they they would have no network they pray on people's hatred of Trump that they created exactly and most people They hated Trump from 2016 2020 have woken up and realized that it was all bullshit. That was the first That was the first media propaganda campaign that was openly aggressive towards A sitting president in that way, okay, never before have we ever had And a president attack that way the way that the media big tech You know fortune 100 companies all unified and attack Trump And a lot of people that don't like Trump they they don't like Trump because of these lies that have been told by CNN And the reason their ratings are tanking is because people have woken up and They are realizing that the harder they push The more obvious it is that these people are lying and so anybody with any sort of humility and the ability to recognize that they were wrong and anybody with a reasonable IQ Is realizing what's going on in the 83,000 people those are just people that are never Trump, bro They fucking hate him no matter what and these are people who are unwilling to admit that they were wrong that they made a bad choice That they were manipulated and a lot of these people are higher education people These are people that went to Yale and Harvard and these they have you know higher up degrees masters degrees These people think that because they went to school they're smarter than everybody else So because they believe that they are unable to admit that Other people who they think are below them or they think are less intelligent than them were actually right about this entire thing So what we're dealing with here Legitimately is not a matter of fact. It's a matter of people's ego And ego in the way that these people are presenting it will get them killed That's the thing they don't understand and a likelihood of them being sick or injured or dying Is way up because they weren't able to process information properly during COVID. No, you see what I'm saying. No, so it's real shit man But you know that that's the only thing that they can they can hang on that goes really for all the left leaning You know MSM Propaganda machine You know, it's like it's just simple stuff. It doesn't matter what it is the stuff like this, you know, Trump's visiting the Bronx today He's having a historic Bronx rally Where there are thousands of people of all different backgrounds there in in force But he's heading there and you know, you leave it to the MSM. These are the things that they're saying here is here's MSMBC As far as work and so you know, Donald Trump is nothing more than a criminal suspect facing 91 felony counts desperately searching for a self-parton So it's obvious to all of us that his priority is not the people the Bronx his priority is a self-parton and self-preservation And I'm confident that the people of the Bronx are not going to buy This snake oil he's selling. I mean his presidency was a catastrophe for the Bronx his mismanagement of COVID Left the death toll of within 7,000 in the Bronx, which is greater than the combined death count of Pearl Harbor 9-11 So instead of holding a rally in Krypton or Park, he should be apologizing through the people of Bronx for the damage he's done That's such a lie That's such a lie 7,000 people may have died during COVID, but they didn't die of COVID and they may have died with a little bit of COVID in them Just like everybody had this goes back to the cycle rate test on the PCR where they were literally testing dead bodies of people who were killed in accidents Who committed suicide and if the cycle rate on the PCR post Mortem said positive they counted it as a COVID death and got paid So this motherfucker thinks that we all forgot what games they were playing. Not only that. Okay, cool. So Trump You know the Bronx look bad and the Trump put okay, so it's been almost four years now. What's the Bronx look like now No shit worse. What's it look like now? Way worse, right and and and cool 7,000 people may have not been killed from COVID this you know these these last four years How many from gun violence? How many people didn't die from the flu that year, right? Right This is a total this is what I'm talking about. Yeah, but dude these people They think that they can get on camera and gaslight Americans into believing that they think that they can say this as if it's true And people will be like yes, it's true And yes, you might have been able to do that before trust was completely shattered between the people and MSM But they are still doing it. Oh, yeah, they're still they think that's gonna work and it's not working It's actually just driving down on Trump's support up. Yeah, and You know to the to the first exchange with Ted Cruz You know They try to do this they try to tell everybody. So are you willing to accept the results of the election? Well, that depends was it fucking fair or was it not fair? These people are always trying to get people corner Would you read would you accept the results of the election if you knew that it was fucking stolen right? No Hillary Clinton's on camera Talking about how Donald Trump was a illegitimate president in 2016 and 17 she's on TV saying this over and over and over again. No one says shit Right no one says shit about it. There's a complete double standard these people are losing the world's closing in on them And they don't know how to react or adjust or pivot other than to continue to gaslight and lie Hoping that people will just believe what they're saying is true because they think that people are sitting at home Or so dumb they just look at this guy and think well, he must know what he's talking about if he's on TV and he's a senator or Representative, yeah, it's dumb shit You know, and like he's in the Bronx, which I believe covers a little bit of AOC's district sheep sheep tweets this out God is good because apparently there's thunderstorms and shit that was going on up there But let's see what it's really like, you know, let's see what the people are how they're feeling I Still there In droves Well, I mean, that's a little like compared to what he has no this was just this morning And this was before security checkpoints where he could set up. Oh really thousands of people. I got after saw another update before But when we started recording So shit's on the people out there. So shit's on you know, we'll try to find those pictures and throw them in here so you don't see no Yeah, man, uh, fuck that Caitlin Collins lady Yeah, she's she's not palatable She's horrible.

Now this was in response to the bluey segment. All right. You remember the bluey? Yeah. I'm sorry, but wait. What about an Otis and Charlie meet and greet? See, now this makes fucking sense. Okay. All right. In front of her fantastic fruit stand, my three year old motto is working. Is hard work makes us happy because of that book. Andy, you could wear a giant bulldog suit. I'm sure you'd love that. See, if it's my shit, it makes sense. Got it. Yeah. If it's a bluey or some other dumb shit, there's something wrong with everybody. Yeah. But if it's me, it's cool. I can see, bro, I can see that. Yeah. Otis and Charlie meet and greet. But that actually be fire. Yeah. Look at that. I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad J high thought of it. I'm glad I thought about that. Oh, you wrote that. That's my, that's my page. J high. That's one of my mouth. Oh, man, we, that's actually a really good idea though. I like it. I could see it. Yeah. Otis and Charlie, but they don't like kids though. No, they're all right. All right. Now that they're a little older, they're pretty cool. They're cool. Okay. All right. Charlie likes everybody. All right. We'll appreciate the, appreciate that, J high. Appreciate that. And appreciate all you guys for being real ass fans. Make sure you guys are liking, commenting and subscribing. Hit that bell notification and stay up to date with the latest shows. Yeah. Because we don't miss. That was smooth. Thanks. Like I had a little brad. I did have a little bradie fart there. Yeah, you did. Just shitting brain there a little bit. All right. So, I'm going to go with the misinformation. Yes. Indeed. Maybe that's a tactic. What if we start censoring ourselves? They won't censor us. You know what I'm saying? Caution. This show is entirely missing. That's what I'm saying. Like we put, we just put that out there up front. And they might say, just say it's comedy. Yeah. It is comedy. It is. It's the funniest shit on the internet and it's diverse comedy. Cultural humor. Yep. Guys, headline number two. Um, with the show. Headline number two reads, ex Fouchy Top Advisor offers apologies and excuses after COVID email revelations. Who buddy? Now this one's hot. Get the fucking gallows. This one is hot. Um, this one's hot. So this, this guy. Um, let me get his picture up here. This guy right here. This is Dr. David Mourins. Okay. Um, now David Mourins. Is a senior advisor for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Um, he just appeared before the House Committee on oversight and accountability, uh, just Wednesday afternoon. Um, to talk through some of these, uh, emails that got uncovered. Okay. Um, and a few of these alarming messages, um, that, that were released, uh, the newly released emails, detailed interactions between Mourins, uh, and Dr. Pierre Dasek, who is the president of the Eco Health Alliance, the non-governmental organization that funded coronavirus research and Wuhan, China. So these are, these are, uh, uh, a few exchanges between these, right? And what these emails are showing, and we have them here for you guys, of course. But they are, they are showing some very concerning, uh, lines of communication here, right? Um, and this guy initially did not try to play ball, um, but after he realized that they had all the shit on them, he just, like, and one of the, one of his things, he just literally just says, I don't know what else to say, but I'm sorry. That's literally what he said in the thing. Um, so, uh, he says, quote, it's just something I'm very ashamed that I can't put the toothpaste back in the tube more instead of the emails, language, uh, much of which he attributed to being just, quote, black humor. What's black humor? I think that's what we do. Is he trying to steal our shit? Probably. He must watch the show. Listen here, motherfucker. All right, black humor is for me. All right. This is our internet. That's it. That's it. All right. Um, but Republican lawmakers accused moreons of deleting emails and using his personal email to skirt freedom of information act request or FOIA requests, right? And so all government accounts, and if you have a government email address, phone, all of that stuff, uh, is open to being FOIAD, right? Um, where the people can put in a FOIA request and we can get those information. We get all, all access to emails, phone calls, uh, text messages on any government device in the government computer or any government email, right? Um, and these emails start showing that, you know, his old ass is, is beginning to become aware of this. Let's just go through some of these emails. This one is from June 16th of 2020. And you can see right here, he is, uh, replying from his personal Gmail account. Okay. Um, he says the FOIAs are dreadful and paranoia inducing in the old days we had to do them ourselves by hand. I mean, finding and printing out thousands of emails coming in and going out. Now they sometimes FOIA text messages to many FOIAs turn up thousands of pages of docs and of course most of meaningless. Um, we are all smart enough to know to never have smoking guns. And if we did, we wouldn't put them in emails. And if we found them, we delete them in my 22 years at NIA ID, I have never seen a FOIA that turned up useful information until now, until now, until now, Mr. David. Um, here's another one. Again, from his personal Gmail, um, but he's still sending these to, uh, to the eco, uh, health alliance. Uh, this email reads Peter, I just got news that a FOIA picked up an email. I sent you saying that Tony commented he was brain dead jokingly, of course. However, Ron Johnson is all over it. And now after me, Tony will be pissed, rightly so. I deleted that email. But now I learned that every email I ever got since, since 1998, it's captured and will be turned over whether or not I instantly deleted it Gmail phone text, I need to scrumptusly rely on those exclusively. I love that way. Hey, they caught me in every single email like they got me. All right. So I got to make sure it just commute like this email is going to get caught too, bro. What a dumbass. This is another one of February 24th, 2021. Uh, again, from this personal Gmail account, uh, quote, you are right. I need to be more careful. However, as I mentioned once before, I learned from our FOIA lady here how to make emails disappear after I am FOIAed. But before the search starts, so I think we are all safe. Plus I did delete it. Most of those earlier emails after sending them to Gmail. I don't know what you mean. So chairman James Comer out of Kentucky is a good guy. I like him. He asked morons if he quote, deleted any records or had conversations with Fauci regarding deletions quote, not to my knowledge. Morons said quote, but again, we're at the issue of defining what's a federal record. I deleted a lot of emails. I do it every day. Um, at one point in the hearing morons offered quote, I don't know what to say. Except I'm sorry. Now listen, I'm it's funny, but it's not funny, right? Um, because there's some more serious shit in these emails. Uh, another released emails, morons appear to express concern about what, uh, what was being sent to his work email and what was, uh, since was personal email, informing those on the email chain that they did not need to worry and that they would, uh, that he would delete anything. I don't want to see in the New York Times. It is not clear if in deletions actually occur. Here, here's the email. Uh, it's just quote, I'm updating you on my computer and gag order situation with the help of my IT folks. I went over the whole computer and phone situation. They loaded some anti hacking software on my phone and discussed the situation with me. Basically, my Gmail is now safe from for you and hacking on all of my devices, including government, computer and phone and my private computer and iPad. Thus it should be safe to communicate safely with you, Peter and others as long as we use my private Gmail. And he goes on to say, please pass this onto Peter and quote, I ask you both that nothing gets sent to me except to my Gmail and make sure that what gets sent to my Gmail doesn't have a CC to another government employee who could be for you. So he's literally like, this is showing the intent of him. Knowing intent of trying to cover up. That's right. This is clearly showing the intent. What are you trying to cover up? Oh, yeah. What would you be trying to cover up? Um, here's another one. Uh, I forgot to clarify on my email yesterday, but that both my Gmail and phone calls are now safe. Text is not as it can be for you. It is it as can my government email. So you and Peter and others should be able to email me on Gmail only, uh, with the caveat that no other government employee is copied at a government address as all government emails are potentially foilable. Um, now what was some of the damning thing that's came out of this? Uh, I don't know. How about this email where he explicitly talks about getting a kickback from the money, uh, that was being funded by taxpayers to all of this COVID nonsense. How about that? Uh, yeah, he asked DASIC for a kickback on an August 27th, 2020 email from Lawrence, Sedassick and coach, uh, with the subject line NIH awards, $7.5 million grant to eco health alliance months after uproar over political interference showed more and asking for monetary reimbursement. He wrote, uh, hum, do I get a kickback too much fucking money? Do you deserve it all hours later? That's a reply. Quote, of course, there's a kickback. It starts with five more years of FOIA requests. The subcommittee said that this action is not only highly concerning, but it is also likely illegal. Federal employees are not allowed to accept gifts from outside parties for their work. Now it's funny because I remember they asked Fauci the same thing and he had some of the same emails, um, asking about these kickbacks that he was getting from Big Pharma for pushing these vaccine narratives, right? Oh, no, that, you know, I'm not going to go into my personal business. These guys are pieces of shit. Point blank period. And what do we got on this? This crimes against humanity. They should be hung. That's what I think. I think when we consider the amount of disruption and what happened, the amount of people that didn't get medical care who, who died from this, who got their businesses ruined, their lives ruined, their families ruined, and all for money, it was all a lie. It was all a multi goal operation of one, uh, you know, preventing down a Trump for winning the election to shuffling all of the money from the middle class into the upper class, which is why they closed your neighborhood stores, but they left all the big chains open. Those are the buddies that give them money. That's why they do that. Um, I mean, dude, we go on and on and on. You know, they were able to impose more control systems. You know, this is how they're starting to get with the social, social, social credit score. If you remember the vaccine passports, they tried to push through the people rejected, you know, they fucking put people in jail. They arrested people. They told people they couldn't go outside. They canceled fucking, you know, school graduations, they canceled school for two and a half years, all of this shit. So these guys can make a fucking couple of dollars and get their way with the power that they want to express over humanity. And this, this was worldwide. This was not just here in America. It was formulated and pushed by the people at the World Economic Forum globally. Um, everybody went along with it because they were all making money and dude, it's crimes against humanity. That's it. That's what it is. And this idea that these people should receive a slap on the wrist or jail time is absurd. How many people died? How many people are going to die? How many people are going to die from the vaccine? How many people haven't even gotten sick yet? They got the vaccine. Right. I would like to see that that one guy from the Bronx recovered earlier. What would you talk? Those seven thousand people in the Bronx. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Was it was was it really Trump? Was it really Trump? Well, that when that guy is saying what those people are saying is the same thing that they were saying during the time, they said Trump wasn't harsh enough with the lockdowns. These people are still fucking not getting it. They're not understanding. This was a lie. This was, dude, they removed the statistics from the flu. The flu didn't kill anyone for two years. What the fuck is wrong with your brain? Right. Okay. On top of that, we go through the testing of the COVID with the PCR tests, like I just talked about earlier, we had multiple experts come on this show, explain how it works. We turn the cycle rate of the PCR tests so high it will detect literally anything as a positive. So they were taking every single positive that was a false positive, pumping it out on the screen on CNN, MSNB, speaking, they weren't talking about deaths. They were talking about cases. Okay. So everybody's that's getting tested. Do you not remember them incentivizing people to get tested? Yeah, because you're able to make money just for one of the testing centers, right? Well, bro, it pumped their data. So they were incentivizing people to go get tested, knowing that most of the tests will come back positive. So then they could pump the data, declare a state of emergency and steal everybody's fucking money and control everything. And dude, this motherfucker was at the top of it. And you know, it is what it is. It's a, it's a, it was a conspiracy to do a whole bunch of different things. One, and here's the fucking, this is, this is the part that nobody's talking about. Who's dying from the vaccine? Who's getting sick? The people that got it, right? Which means those are the people that are most vulnerable to fucking being manipulated by these people, right? And we would consider those people less intelligent than the rest of the people, right? Okay. So wouldn't it make sense if you were going to call a population that you would remove the dumbest people, not the smartest people? You ever think about that? Maybe we were all just supposed to just shut up. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. No, I really think that's part of it. I think that a lot of the people that didn't get it were just supposed to shut the fuck up and let the people who were all about it get it. I mean, that's some, some, some Thanos theory thing. Yeah. And then we're all over here fucking think of how brilliant. We're trying to save everybody. We're trying to save these motherfuckers and they're trying to ruin our lives. Calling us grandma killers, calling our businesses, trying to get us fired, trying to get us canceled. We're trying to fucking save them. And from these fucking fucks who think they're better than you that not only think they know they're better than you, right? Ask them. You know, this is so fucked up, bro. These people deserve legit, not, not just a normal like go in and get injected with some chemicals and die. They, they deserve to be made an example of so that nobody ever does this again in the history of the world. Like real talk. I'm talking harsh shit. I'm talking like legit, something that would be remembered for a thousand years. And people with a fuck we better not do that because this is what's going to happen. Yeah, man. And they prompt this guy up. One fucking magazine. Yeah, he's on in style and women, these fucking brunch women are talking about how he's sexy at their rage rituals. It's fucking insane, dude. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation, we love to hear you guys's thoughts. A lot of us know down in the comments, what you guys think he ain't going to get away with it. I don't think everybody keeps saying all they're going to get away with it. No, they're not. No, they're not. I don't think so. I don't. Guys, what's up? He's still, let's keep, let's keep this train moving. We got to head on number three. Now back to your other favorite people. All right, other than all of all of them. This one is, I don't even know what the fuck to make of this. So let's just, let's give this a try. All right, this headline number three reads. Peacock TV to air queer planet documentary on gay bisexual and trans animals. Return of the frogs, gay. NBC's universal streaming outlet peacock TV is set to air a documentary about gay, lesbian and transgender animals titled queer planet, prompting a wide range of reaction on social media. Peacock unveiled a promo for the documentary, which will premiere next month. Quote, queer planet delves into gay penguins by sexual lions and sex changing clownfish with one of the experts interviewed for the documentary, saying that, quote, it's only in humans that we have such a stigma about it. All right. Let's watch it. If you're not gay, you know, you're a fuck. Just remember, you're going to keep jamming us with gay shit until we're all fucking gay. You know, it couldn't stop with just like, hey, we're going to get married and have the same rights now. It's if you're not gay, you're a fucking big it. Right. Make your dog gay too. Yeah. Your dog fucking a new Otis has been looking at me a little weird lately. Yeah. I'm just so fucking. Yeah, he's black people. That's what it is. That's what it is. That's what it is. Yeah, he's not gay. He just races. That's what it's. Let's watch this. Let's watch this little trailer here, man. Here it is. Queer planet. The paparazzi really are everywhere. Everything you were told as a kid is wrong. Yes. Gay penguins, bisexual lions, sex changing clownfish. This is a queer planet. Queerness has always existed. It's only in humans that we have such a stigma about it. The idea of just having two fixed sexes is clearly out of style. Mother nature is pretty open-minded. Sex is not just for reproduction. It's clear that no matter where you look on our planet, nature is full of queer surprises. To be honest, we should probably get laid a little more than we do. Speak for yourself, homie. Any of my fault. No, we want to fuck you, bro. I mean, here's the thing, man. If we were all gay, there would be more people. We would cease to exist. Hmm. Like, I love how they just take one example of something. There's a fucking penis. Uh-huh. And then there's like a slot. Like for the penis to go. And then the penis shoots some shit up in there. Yeah, it does. And then a baby comes out. But that's wrong. No, no, that's a stigma. That's wrong. Yeah. That's how it works. How it actually works. Is through the shoot. Yeah, you got to put it in the butt. That's how it like broke. That's normal. Do the that's totally normal, man. That's why you know, the fact that there's actually like a vagina. That's just that's that's just that's not liar. Yeah, not supposed to even be there. It's just a coincidence. Dude, I'll tell you what I think I speak for everybody. Like we're tired of having this shit jam down a fucking throat. Yeah, you well, here's the scary thing. All right, this is this is everything is fucking gay now. Everything's fucking everything. Everything. And if you say anything about it, there's something wrong with you. Like gay people are tired of gay shit. You know what I mean? That's real. Like dude, even I mean, even they're tired of taking it up a shoot. No, they're fucking tired of. Oh, you mean the narrative? Yeah, they're tired of the of the gayness being pushed on people because they're understanding that it's making people look at them different. Like I fuck you. Right. Not only that, you know, here's one thing that they don't they don't because listen, like you know, everybody is like you got a male dog. It'll hump other dogs, male dogs. That doesn't mean the dogs gay. Okay, that is a that is a or a section that they use to this is just a difference. This is just a different version of grooming children. Children in the audience for these fucking nature shows that's who fucking watches them who watches the animal shit. And this is this is for these fucking parents who think they're being open minded and who think they're, you know, their kids trans at two years old shit. Bro, the correction that's going to need to take places is so big. You know what I'm saying? It's so big. Well, here's the thing then because you know, you mentioned that like, you know, people are people are over it. And even gay people are over it. Yeah. But here's the thing, man, these people that are pushing this stuff, they are at a point now where they know that people are over it and they don't care. Yeah. We had over to LGBTQNation.com. And they have their article on this titled Conservatives are freaking out because they learn that some animals are gay. No, we're freaking out because we're tired of your shit. Yeah. Where they say, you know, a new animal documentary from NBC's Universal Streaming Platform peacock is exploding the myth that there is a heterosexual male female Noah's Ark binary ordering our sexuality. The queer planet doc is also exploding heads on the far right. Forced portrayal of same sex animal relationships and creatures that transition from one sex to another. No, that's not why people are upset at all. No, people are upset because you're taking children's shows and you're making them gay. You're reading books to kids that they shouldn't be reading in school. You're having drag queens go to school when they're fucking three or four, five, six years old and act like that's normal. It's not normal. Nothing about it's an outlier. Okay. And that's adult entertainment. And these parents who support this shit should have their kids fucking taken away from that's the truth. When these parents have a three year old and they're saying this kid is trans or the kids just born and it's out of the womb and they got tranche flags hanging in the fucking dude. That's fucking mental abuse from the start. They put a fucking newborn baby on the on the chest of a man expecting it to fucking feed and then given the man hormones so that the baby could get something out of the nipple so the man can be justified about his quote unquote motherhood. It's so so the baby's got to drink off your disgusting man, nipple, chemical juice, drink the chemical juice and fuck it because you want to be validated as a woman, which you are not. We're no studies being done and know the effects of that chemical juice and how that's abuse. It's abuse and the and the these people have it wrong. Nobody's freaking out because animals. Some animals my fuck each other. No one's doing that. But the vast majority of animals don't do that. And that's not quote unquote normal. You are presenting it as normal. It is not normal. And on top of it, just to cap this all off, you guys blast every single human being with pro gay propaganda 24 seven 365 all the time, bro. And people are fucking tired of it. They want to fucking go to the zoo without being told, hey, that's lions, but fuck each other. Right. You know what I'm saying? They want to be able to turn on the TV like dude, it's you guys got 67 fucking holidays in a full month and then another month in October and all this shit. People are tired of it. It's exhausting. That's what's happening. No one's freaking out because of gay people. We actually 10 years ago, everybody was pretty cool. There was gay people, there was other people, everybody got along and nobody gave a fuck. Now the reason people are freaking out and give a fuck is because the aggressive marketing and the aggressive propaganda of shoving this down. Everybody's throat is getting fucking old and it's getting tired. It's in every motherfucking commercial. It's in every motherfucking movie. It's an every fucking thing that we look at and we're fucking tired of it. That's the truth. And it has nothing to do with big a tree or this or that. We don't know what's going around shoving anything else down. Everybody's fucking face like that. Yeah, just because you like stuff shoved out your throat. Don't mean I do broke. And you know, it's dangerous, dude, because it's turning people who are reasonable and who are common sense people who are like, you know, do those people deserve to be treated the same way. There's nothing wrong with them. Like let them get married. Like like a lot of people who were allies to the gay community, they have turned against are now like dude. Fuck you guys. And that comes down from the gay community needs to stand up against this shit. It's exhausting. And the regular gay people that we talk to agree with what I'm saying. They're like, dude, this is embarrassing. It's fucking embarrassing. Everything's got a fucking rainbow. Nobody even thinks of a rainbow as a rainbow anymore. Right. Like our kids can't even think of a rainbow as a normal rainbow anymore because of what these fucking people have done. It's absurd. And I realize that this is not this does not reflect the views of the majority of the gay community. The majority of the gay community are normal people who happen to be gay and they're sick of this shit too. So it's we got to be careful who we point the finger at here. But dude, honestly, I'm fucking tired of it. I'm tired of everywhere. I look, it's fucking just prop gay propaganda fucking everywhere. Like say whatever you want about me straight. Shit is even even isn't even pushed like that. I don't know if you say that to them, they will say they will say, well, that's the baseline. The straight shit is the regular accepted. It's the way it is. Well, that's because it's the truth. That's because that's how humans and animals and every. The only reason those lions are even there is because they're fucking parents. What in the end? Yeah, like we got to be real or you're dude. I'm just tired of it. Dude, and I don't give a fuck if people want to be treated equal, but this isn't equal anymore. This is fucking, this is privilege. And it's getting old. Well, guys, jump in on this conversation. You guys checking out queer plan and let us know down in the comments. What's your guys think on this with that being so I love how it's such certainty they're talking about. Like, oh, the planet, Mother Nature really is open minded. No, let's look at the stats. Let's look at the statistics about how many of these animals are fucking, but fucking each other. And and how many aren't. Right. Okay, it's not normal. It's no matter how much you say it's normal. It's going to come down to the data. Normal means more people do that than don't. Right. That is not the case. That's not the case with homosexuality. That's not the case with animals being gay. It's not the case with anything. The only thing it's the case in is the amount of fucking holidays that we got to celebrate. A bunch of people who derive their entire identity off of who they like to fuck. Like how weird would it be for me to walk around all fucking day long and be like, bro, I love pussy. I fucking love pussy. Do you love pussy? If you don't love pussy, there's something wrong with you. Right. Right. No, I'm just saying bro, oh, you don't like you don't like pussy. I'm a binary. No, you're a little sexual. You're a fucking big. Hey, watch my movie on getting pussy. Right. Like that's what the fuck we're talking about here. Like it's it's obscene. It's absurd. It's ridiculous. And dude, we need to get some common sense back in the world. If we're going to fucking cohabitate the surf because dude, I for one and I know I'm speaking for a lot of people, I'm fucking tired of it. Yeah. What I mean, what do you think? I'm exhausted, bro. I the thing that I hate man and it's like, bro, it's the people that fucking don't get any attention anywhere else. Do you ever notice these they know they wouldn't matter at all? Bro, it's their whole identity. Yeah. Imagine making your whole identity who you want to fuck your whole identity. If you were to say that about a heterosexual person, you would say they were a sexual deviant. You would say they were fucking they had a problem. They were a lymphomaniac or a pervert. Like if someone walked around, that's all they talked about and they wore a symbol on their shirt that said, I love pussy. And it was, you know, maybe it wasn't a rainbow, but it was a fucking taco, right? Like, bro, no, I'm being serious. And if you don't put a taco stick on your fucking computer, fuck you. That's the attitude these people have. It's insane. The part that I really don't like, man, and it's like, you know, I never thought that I would have to, you know, would have to do this. I never thought it, you know, but like, you know, we always know that, you know, I, like I got two kids, right? And I was like, yes, I'm like, I know my job is to protect them, right? And but like, I've never thought that I would have to protect them from fucking seeing rainbow shit or going to tar, you know what I'm saying? Like that was, I'm thinking of like the boogie man under the bed thinking of the, you know, I'm saying like, that's the criminal criminals, right? Like that, their teachers at school. Exactly. Exactly. The whole landscape, man, it's completely different and it's, it's sad, you know, and I'll say this like even just from my perspective, but like listen, there is zero tolerance. Let, let, please let me go out. Pleat. Like I, I pray for the day, bro, that I'm in a fucking store and Ryan goes to the bathroom and there's a, I pray for it. Well, dude, and the other thing is too is that these people have adopted this mentality that their, your children are theirs. Yeah, that's, yeah. Your children, you're, you're the fucking bad guy because you don't agree with them. And they have the right as an educator to teach your kid anything they want. And most of it has to revolve around their own sexuality. Why do we have teachers talking to kids about who they like to have sex with? Should we have that? That's not appropriate at all. Those people are fucked in the head and have no business being around kids. Have you ever seen these tip top videos of these fucking goofy looking women on there being like, oh, today, you know, my children asked me whether I was a boy or a girl. And I said that mixed Stevens is, you know, whatever mixed Stevens wants to be today. And it's like, what the fuck are we doing? What does that have to do with the alphabet? Dude, it will teach me the other alphabet. You know what I'm saying? It's like, what are we doing? Bro, I'm sick of pretending like this is okay. No, it's not. It's not okay. It's not, and I'm like I said earlier in the show. If one of these people came up to you 10, 15 years ago and said, hey, here's what we're going to do today. You're going to call me, they, them. By the way, I'm going to teach your kid about sucking dick in school. By the way, if you don't let me, I'm going to call the police on you. Right. I'm going to get you fired. I'm going to ruin your life. I think if you went up to someone 10, 15 years ago and said that to them. Now it's just accepted because people are so pussy, they don't want to speak out against what they know to be wrong. And if you don't have the courage to speak out against what you know to be wrong, you are failing as a fucking human being. Period. Like that guy in the comments, oh, white guys are worst case scenario. Like, what are you talking about? Right. We're at worst case scenario. It doesn't get any worse than this. The next step is that people like this ended up being fucking slaughtered because of the shit that they do. And this has happened in history over and over and over and over again. And when they talk about persecution, they don't tell the other side of persecution, which is that these people got so comfortable jamming shit down people's throat and fucking with people's lives and getting involved that eventually people just revolted. Yeah, they never tell you why they're as per usual. That's right. They never say that. And this has happened in history, fucking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times over and over again. And it's because the same fucking attitude happens. These people get comfortable, then they start fucking imposing their will on other people. And people don't like to have other people's will imposed on them. They want to be left to fuck alone. Even if it's right, dude, even if it is right, they want to be left alone. Our grace as humans as Americans has been taken advantage of. Mm-hmm. Hey, man. We need to stop turning the other cheek with any of this evil shit. Yeah. Dude, and I want to make it clear. I don't have any problem with fun gay people. At all. At all. But when you're one of these people who jams this shit down, everybody's thrown at every fucking place and every fucking way and every blah, blah, blah, dude, fuck you. That's people like him. Yeah. Fuck, dude. People like him. That guy's not even worth a fucking whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, with that big segment, let's get to our final segment of the show. We have thumbs up or dumbest fuck this word. We bring a headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. With that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads. Watch. NASCAR driver Brad C- What is that? How do you pronounce that, Andy? I don't know. Kansalski? Kansalski? Kansalski? Kansalski. Kansalski. Kelsalowski. Kelsalowski. I don't know. Hey for effort. NASCAR driver Brad Kelsalowski's daughter takes race-winning American flag to school for Pledge of Allegiance. So NASCAR star Brad Kelsalowski made the American flag a central part of his post-victory celebration. And the next day his daughter continued to celebrate by bringing old glory to school for the Pledge of Allegiance. Kelsalowski notched his first win in three years someday with a win at the good year 400 at Darlington. And celebration of the big win, Kelsalowski did a victory lap while holding the American flag out of his window. Here's a clip. KELSEY WISKEY Good play. KELSEY WISKEY That's pretty fucking cool. So then on Monday, Kelsalowski's wife, Paige posted a video of their daughter taking that same flag to school for the Pledge of Allegiance. So no one happier than this girl, Paige Kelsalowski wrote, she wanted to take the race-winning flag to school today so her class could use it for the Pledge of Allegiance. Here it is. They're walking in the school with it. I think that's fucking great. I think that's great. Now, I'm not big into NASCAR, I don't think. I don't, you know what I'm saying? I started watching that reality series on a Netflix about it. Oh, there's like a formula one version type thing. That's pretty good. Really? Yeah. I never, my dad loves NASCAR. I don't know really anything about it. Yeah, same. I do know that I like when they fight though. Yeah. I guess I'll need it. Did you see that fight that happened? They fight all the time. Yeah, there was a, it was a Ricky Stinhouse Jr. and Kyle Busch. Yeah. They have a fight. Did you see that? We got a little heated. I love it. I'm gonna throw it over I was making a left turn. I tried to make a left turn. He's pissed now. He ain't gonna hit him back. He's gonna have to work with someone, hit you and then you can hit him back. Listen, that's my number one. It's the fucking worst. That's my number one rule, bro. If we're in the skirmish and you grabbed me, I'm gonna beat your ass. I just, I'm saying. Bro, don't say it when someone fucking punches you first and then fucking dudes grab you. Don't you don't fucking grab me. I fucking hate to be now, y'all. Well, fucker me. I'm gonna be hitting him before you. That's what I'm saying. Like, if you wanna grab anybody, grab that motherfucker. Let me grab him me. No, we're gonna stop that guy's fucking face off. 1000%. Yeah. 1000%. But it's cool to see that I'm gonna say I didn't know who did it. Fuck, I don't know who did that. We're that guy, the guy fucking ran off. Sir, it looks like it looks like your shoe print on his, that's not my shoe. Oh, so they, they stop making fucking, they stop making these shoes after I bought it. Yeah, you know, the only one with these shoes. It's NASCAR, everybody's wearing the same shit. Yeah. No, everybody's wearing crocs. Yeah. Right. It's, no, it's just cool to see the dynamic though. You know what I'm saying? Let's see this side of NASCAR within, you know, that's real competition. See these girls, you know, this young girl, man. Yeah, bro, there's a lot of good in America, man. But here's the thing, guys, if you stop it, if you don't speak up for what you know to be wrong and true, we're gonna lose it. And this idea that other people have to say all the uncomfortable shit before you say it is ridiculous. Okay. Like, dude, how much support do we get from the show? Right. And then how many of those same people are actually bringing that message to their house, their neighborhood, their school, talking the truth about what they feel. Right. Like, dude, if you guys don't join in, the culture's not gonna change. The culture has to change. All right. This shit is absurd. Making gay animal shows and fucking reading gay books and trans books and all this shit putting kids on hormone, all this shit. You guys all know it's wrong. But you won't speak out because you're afraid someone's gonna call you a name, fuck them. Fuck them all. Let them call you whatever the fuck they want. That's their only power over you. That's the reason we're here. The reason we're here is because we aren't able to point out very obvious statistical realities in society because we get called names when we do. Well, dude, I hate to break it to you, but there's bullshit and then there's real shit. And real shit is statistically proven shit. Okay. When we look at the crime rate in this country, those are statistics. That tells a real story. When we look at the abortions, that's a real thing. When we look at the economy, that's a real thing. It doesn't matter how you fucking feel about it. It's the data. Okay. And the data says that we are dealing with a fucking communist coup that's happening in our country. This is happened a hundred times before and every single time that it happens, when we are told, we cannot persecute the people who are criminals. We cannot talk about the truth. We have to censor our speech. Bad things happen because of that. And every single one of those scenarios, you know what happened? Genocide. Eventually. So you guys should think about that. People should think about that. You can either speak up and tell the truth or you can wait until there's nobody left to speak up and tell the truth and you're going to be standing all the fuck alone. Right now we have a country of people that recognize what's going on is wrong and they're still now while I agree, they are standing up more than they were. You guys need to stand up a lot more than what you are. We got a long way to go, man. Yeah. The shit's absurd. The thumbs up, man. Good shit for keeping your daughter in line with the right shit, man. I think that's awesome. Um, thumbs up on that. Yeah. Andy guys. Yeah. Don't be a hoe. Yeah. Never sleep in on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, fuck up, stoke. Counting millions in the cold. Bad bitch, booty swoke. Got a own bank row. Canked folk. Dusset note. Hint. Shot. Case closed.
