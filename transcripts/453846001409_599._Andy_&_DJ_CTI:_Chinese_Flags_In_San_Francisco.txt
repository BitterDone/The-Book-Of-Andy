What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real let's say goodbye to the lies, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome. The mother fucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ crews the mother fucking internet. That's what we're gonna do. That's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet. This is where we put topics up on the screen. We talk about them. We speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people are the solution to the problems going on in the world. Other times you tune in we have Q and A F. That's where you can submit questions and we give you the answers. You can submit your questions one of a couple different ways. The first way is you can go on YouTube on the Q and A F episodes which typically post on Mondays and drop your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Other times we have real talk real talk just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk. Then other times we have full length. That's where we have an interesting guest coming sitting studio. We have a conversation and then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where somebody who has completed the 75 hard program who had a shit show of a life before no longer has a shit show of a life. And then they come on the show and talk to you about how they did it. So if you're interested in 75 hard which is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the most popular mental conditioning program that's ever been created in the history of mankind. You can get it for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. So we don't want to add on the show you're going to notice that and exchange for that we have this thing called the fee. The fee is very simple because I'm not going to fill your head with a bunch of ads and be beholden to a bunch of advertisers telling me what I can and can't say I ask very simply that you help us spread the word. If the show makes you think make sure laugh it gives you a new perspective. If it opens your eyes and things if you think it's a message that needs to be heard please do your part and share the show you know we get shadow band we get traffic throttled we get the worst parts of the censorship issue going on in this country and without you guys sharing the show people don't hear it so. Don't be a home show the show alright. It's going on brother. Oh not much. Yeah question. What came first the chicken of the egg. I don't know man. Well if we knew that if we knew that answer it wouldn't be the quote you know we wouldn't have heard that question a million times. Yeah well it's a metaphor right because we've all seen this right. This post right here is it was shared around maybe a couple of months ago I know we talked about it on a prior CTI right where shows like you know they do something comes out about Biden and then the hammer trunk. Another indictment right now the next day the very next day right it's a very interesting thing so I maybe think what came what comes first to check another egg because they did it again. Oh they did it again yeah so so I don't know if you guys seen this but so there was a win for Trump right. This headline reads New York judge lifts Trump gag order and silver frog trial over free speech concerns as they should right because I mean it was completely unconstitutional right. The New York judge is lifted the gag order imposed on former president Donald Trump and a civil fraud trial stemming from state attorney general of Tisha James lawsuit against him and the Trump organization. Siding concerns over free speech appeals court judge David Friedman issued a stay on the order Thursday which was put in place by judge Arthur and Goren in October. And Goren who's overseeing Trump's trial imposed the partial gag order to block all parties for making derogatory statements about his court staff you know the one staffer that was you know allegedly messing around with Schumer you know I'm saying yeah yeah so so that happens right so so it gets lifted that's a great win so it's a big win for first amendment rights it's cool. But then that came or the chicken I don't know which one you know that classified box thing that Biden did which was you know equivalently the same thing is Trump did yeah he just got off on all those charges. Well did they did they charge Trump with that though yeah that's what part of the shit is going on with the Dave Smith prosecutor for it for that case so he's got like four separate cases going on all at once. And like the biggest thing on that case with Trump it's like he was I mean he was president he's lawfully able to declassify anything at any time you need a special permission or Biden I mean he's got stuff everywhere yeah I mean I'm not surprised are you surprised no not not surprised I just think it's funny that like okay if there's a loss on Biden here's a loss for Trump Trump gets a W here's a W for like like it's just so obvious the timeline of this. The timeline of this stuff yeah I mean at this point dude I mean I think everybody understands the corruption double standard that's going on and if they don't they're completely brainwashed to one side or the other I mean if you have any rational ability to to think no matter what you feel about either candidate I mean clearly see there's double standard there's a double standard that benefits the Democrats and the leftist you know people. In literally every area of society right now you know how much the can you think of any double standard that's like going our way no not a single one I can't think of one either yeah but they you know it's you know it happens in the legal system happens in politics happens in the media happens crime yeah and crime I mean it's ridiculous there's a there's a far left communist standard that is being held up. By you know all of these people and the corruption is deep dude it's it's in the media it's in politics in the courts it's it's everywhere and you know the good news is I think people are starting to see it more than they've seen it you know this entire time I think it was real easy for a lot of people to see you know in COVID I think a lot of people woke up you know and then as progressively as things started to unravel specifically when we got to the point where they're starting to persecute Trump for each other. And keep them off the ballot and try to like ruin this guy before the election I think people are starting to see it even if you know they don't like Trump they're they're they're able to see it and you know it's dangerous because a lot of people see it and they're not saying anything or they they they think it's okay because it's working in their benefit right now. But the reality is is you know what I worry about is that it's setting a precedent for the pendulum to come from the other direction next time. And eventually when we deal with these two extremes right this extreme left in this extreme right and it goes back and forth this is eventually how genocide's happened and this is how you know wars happen in civil wars and conflicts and you know it's something that I've been talking about for years and been warning everybody about. But you know my voice just isn't big enough to to really make that level of a change you know when we look at people who could have made the change they opted out of making the change you know what I mean like a lot of these big time celebrities that bow down and took a knee when they were literally at the top of the funnel in terms of traffic and getting the word out you know. It's it's disappointing dude because now we're in a situation where the pendulum is swinging back and I do believe I do believe that most people are shifting the over to window back to the right. And we're going to have to see what happens you know like ultimately what what should happen is hopefully that we would get a leader that we're like not be so. Generalizing in their response you know what I mean like I feel like the people who are breaking the law need to be held accountable and we can't lump in entire groups of people into that right like that's where it gets dangerous correct and that's what I worry about like look do there's a difference between Democrats and left us. All right Democrats are capitalist people who are good normal people who have liberal leaning views and like if we went back 20 years I would be considered a Democrat because I don't have a problem with things like gay marriage or just basic middle of the road social issues but we were we're getting in a position now where the Democrats are being lumped in with leftist and Democrats are typically capitalist leftists are going to be a lot of things. They're communist who are progressive and these are the people who are corrupting society at the highest level and so like these people who are making these decisions at a high level to implement all of these things right. Those are the people that need to be held accountable not entire an entire political ideology side unless it's communist and real talk that's how I feel communist should not be allowed to exist in America at all. Speaking of that pendulum swinging back it's funny you say that did you see that video of Michael Rappaport come on. Yeah I did yeah that guy talks a lot of dumb shit a lot of dumb stuff I mean he said like he must live in his I don't like I always liked to listen actor I thought he's a great actor he was in fucking copland I was just watching copland with Sylvester Sloan he was he not didn't see it I'll bro it's good yeah fuck it's a good movie dude. Let's check this video real quick yeah there's been other things too there's been other things too there's other times where I'm sure like I don't for dick staying dollar from who I had conversations with I might vote for that motherfucker oh yeah I'll break the fucking oh yeah I'll break your hearts. Let me tell you something things don't get straightened up in this fucking world ASAP and I know smoking Joe has said the right thing about Israel. But when I'm seeing motherfuckers in New York City climb in public in front of crowds of people rip down you in flags rip down Israeli flags rip down American flags on Veterans Day when the economy is the way the economy is when I'm paying fucking mortgage rates up the walk up I mean I'm getting forget it forget a colonoscopy. You don't need to get a colonoscopy go go buy a house. Can't the interest rates go buy a car and I know smoking Joe has done some things for the I know but I'm telling you right now go go buy yourself go check go check what it's like to buy a car buy a house buy groceries the fucking chaos in this country the chaos around the world but I'm too far down the gringo man dingo I'm too far down the disruptive warrior rabbit hole to pull back now the comments have been made I said I've had conversations with some of my if it comes down to pig dick down Trump and smoking Joe Biden I'm sorry I am sorry voting for pig dick down Trump is on the table I'm sorry I'm fucking I still call him Slop dick down Trump pig dick down Trump and all that but we need to get this whole fucking situation under control agreed I mean I do free will yeah but hold on bro like what is wrong with these people's brains that they cannot understand that there is consequences to your vote that affects you. Consequences to your okay like when things are good everybody wants to talk about all these abstract concepts that don't affect us in a daily life it's above the line issues and below the line issues and all these people this guy included we're talking all this bullshit about this fake racism about you know Charlottesville and all of your people that are on the table you know, Charlottesville and all these made up fucking Russia collusion, all this shit, right? Without ever considering that like, dude, these progressive leftists will destroy the country to the point where you're not doing well anymore. Your life isn't looking the way that it's supposed to look. Shit is more expensive. And now what's happening is Biden's coming out on TV, so Bidenomics is working. It's working for who? For them? Yeah. There's not a single person that voted for Joe Biden, bro. That's looking at Biden. Like when he says Bidenomics is working, everybody who voted for him, you, they know that they fucked up. Like you have to know, right? You know what I'm saying? Because you're seeing it in your own life. And I, this should be a lesson for every single one of those people. Like, dude, there are above the line issues. Above the line issues are the economy, crime. These are things that affect you on a daily basis, all right? Then there's below the line issues. These things like abortion. These things like, you know, there's a million other ones. But the point is we should evaluate what is going to affect our lives potentially and be voting on those issues. And that's common sense for everybody except these fucking far left people. Like dude, I don't understand too many. Like that just like this video is a great example of just a low IQ person. I think so too. He can't put together the fact that the situation we are in is because of the things that he was saying. And because of the narrative that he put, look, bro, this guy's in the boat. Look, dude, he look, he's get get a big mouth and he's got a following and people love to troll this dude because literally if we go back over the last four years of existence where this guy's been ranting like this, he's been wrong. He's the antithesis of us. Every time he's been wrong, every single fucking time on every single issue. You know what I'm saying? Oh, for three thousand. Yeah. And you ever notice how these are the loudest people? Like dude, you fucked up. You were just looking at camera and say, you know what, man? I don't know what I think I know. I was wrong. I believe the lies they lied to me too. Like tell the truth. Instead of like trying to hang on to your pride, like I would respect this dude if he were like looking at camera and be like, you know what, man? I was a dumb man. Yeah. And I got taken advantage of it. Cause like dude, we've been what this is as propaganda, man. Like we grow up with an idea that what's on the news is the truth. And what's been on the news for the last 15 years has not been the truth. It's been lies. It's been made up things. It's been social initiatives. And all of these things have been put into place for control and the technology combined with it has crafted a certain segment of society to go to the comp like almost to the communist level and some across the line. And you know, I mean, dude, like you have to be a fucking idiot to like keep voting the same way you're going to vote. It's like people who move from California and then go wherever they're going and still vote for the same shit. Like why the fuck did you move, dude? Like really, man, what it showed like here's what I've learned. And it is what it is. Is that there is there's seriously like a whole lot of very low IQ people that believe they have high IQ because they went through the progressive liberal education system and got awarded a piece of paper that says you're so smart, right? Call it degree. And there's just a lot of people who who believe they're super intelligent because the system that was created to create good little worker bees, good little robots said you're a good little robot. And they come out and they think they're they're they're more intelligent than you. Like bro, all you do was kick, stands every weekend. Bro, and not only that, you follow directions enough to get awarded a piece of paper. You didn't question anything. You didn't think about anything. You didn't have any critical like thinking exercises or discussions. You did what you're told. That's what it degrees for. Yeah, dude. So, dude, dumb people think this smart. Smart people don't think this smart. Dude, I don't know, man, like I think there's a definitive IQ difference. I think there's a lot of people who believe that they're very intelligent because the system has told them they're intelligent when in reality, they're not intelligent. Intelligence is the ability to process information and come up with your own conclusion about it. That's not what these people have been trained to do. These people have been trained to hear information and parrot it. And then they were given a word for that. And so they believe, well, that that piece of paper from Harvard says, I'm a genius. Well, I'm sorry, but your words and actions show that you're a dumbass. You know what I'm saying? Like right last thing on this, man, because I, you know, it is interesting to see these things come out, man. I don't know if the world's about to end or what. Did you see the Snoop dolloc's not smoking no more? No more Wii for some side. Yeah, I saw him say that. I mean, here's this tweet, man. He's like, I'm giving up smoke after much consideration and conversation with my family. I've decided to give up smoke. Please respect my privacy at this time. I go, man, like, I feel like a troll. You think so? Feels like a troll. Dude, he smokes. It feels like a troll. Like all of it. Yeah. I mean, cool, man. He's going to cold turkey more for us. I don't know what this dude has a fucking like full-time roller a lot of those guys do a lot of the big celebrities smoke. They got a roller that goes around with them. Like that's insane. And just go cold turkey. All right. Yeah. I mean, look, dude. Snoop dogs know some shit. Here's the deal. I support anybody doing what they need to do to get better. If he thinks that's what he needs to do, yeah, that's great. Yeah. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop smoking. I'm just being real. I'm not stopping. I fucking love it. I love it. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, let's get into our headlines, man. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFacela.com. You can find them linked there. If you're watching on the tube, check down in the description below. You can find them linked there as well. So with that being said, man, let's get into our headlines. Headline number one. Before we get into the headlines, I do want to address day in the life is coming, guys. I know I promised you on November 8th. We had a little bit of a we had some switching in our schedules a little bit. So I got that coming soon. And also I know that we've had the show. It's been irregular. But you know, I got a day job, man. This is it. This is it my main gig, you know, like I don't sit in front of a microphone every day. What the post says, bro, I'm not one of these guys who just has a microphone that sits in front of it to make some shit for the internet. Like I actually do things in real life. I know it's contrary to typical entrepreneur podcast or culture these days where they actually have a job and actually work. So when do you entrepreneur then? Yeah, right. So I just want to let you guys know, you know, every once in a while, that's how it goes here. So we'll be back on schedule. I believe this next week. Yeah. So that's a little housekeeping. Also, MSCEO project getting ready to launch soon, too. So keep an eye out and email. After all my email list, I'll notify you guys on email for that. So yeah. All right, man. Well, let's get into headline number one. I had a lot of newborn reads. Watch Chinese flags, line San Francisco streets for Xi Jinping. Oh man. Yeah. It's a disturbing image. Dude, it's like it's like that movie red dawn. I don't know if that was trying to not, but one what, or the each movie it was different one. It was Russian one. It was China. I think of the newer one. It was China. Yeah. Yeah, it was, I mean, it was an eerie feeling, dude. Like watching these videos, man. So this is a bright bar article. Chinese flags parading through the streets of San Francisco ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping have been met with backlash as videos circulate on social media. Here's one video. I thought this was fucking Hong Kong or something at first. Now if it was Hong Kong, the buildings would be nicer. That's a fact. That's true. That's true. It's a disturbing image, bro. Who puts this shit together? Like who, I want to know who organizes the people on the streets, bro. Like that's my question. Because like, I mean, there's always something deeper going on. It's like the bricks that show up at protests. It's, you know what I'm saying? Like, who is organizing that shit at the grassroots level? Like, I don't know, but I mean, it only looks like there's about 150 people there. I mean, total. I mean, it's not like a lot of people. Yeah. But, but here's the reality is that this should be very disturbing images for anybody who is American. When we have a world leader who basically threatens us all the fucking time every other day. Okay. Yeah. And we we clean up a city and remove all the homeless people, right? Bro, what? That shit would move like, yeah, they clean San Francisco up like two days. Yeah, it's insane, bro. But they have no problem leaving it shitty for all its citizens and its taxpayers and people who, you know, like I've had so many fears. Well, I've had a lot of friends who have had to move out of San Francisco because the environment has become so detrimental to their businesses that they own that they've had to move to places like Texas and Florida. And the fact that they would allow their city to be totally destroyed by the homelessness and the drugs and the crime. And then clean all up in one day for Z-Shipping and not its own citizens. That's insane. That's insane. Did you see his response to that? Who knew something's news? Yeah, yeah. Like, like I said, he said, well, you know, I know a lot of people are saying that we cleaned up the city because the fancy leaders are coming to town and, you know, that's the truth because it's true. Like, yeah, like, bro, yeah, I got it here. I got it. I know folks say, oh, they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming in the town. That's true because it's true. Oh, man, but it's also true for months and months and months. The people that have a different conversation. Dude, they're laughing. Folks say, oh, they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming in the town. That's true because it's true. How the fuck are you going to laugh at that? It's true. For months and months and months and months and months and months and months. Prior to and then we have, we have people talking about this guy running for president, dude. You're going to vote for this fucking guy when he's fucking laughing about our cities being total shittles and cleaning him up for Chinese Communist leaders. This is fucking insane, man. They're more worried about impressing them than they are. Take care of our own people. Where do those homeless people go? Look, bro, these people belong in fucking jail. Okay, this dude belongs in jail. All these people are traders. All these people have sold out to the Chinese government. They're willing to hand over our country for their own benefit on a silver platter to our literal enemy. Like, that's what we're dealing with here, dude. And this guy doesn't have any business running for anything. This guy should be running for like, if he's folding the underwear or the towels or cooking the slop in the prison. Like, that's what the fuck he should be running for. And all of these guys, the fact that these two people behind him are laughing when he says that. That's not funny, dude. How many, like, how many lives have been ruined by the neglect of these leftist leaders? It's disgusting. Dude, if I was a citizen of California and I'm watching that, like, how, how pissed off would you be? Like, you're going up and down the streets of your own city. It's a shithole. There's people everywhere. There's trash everywhere. There's drugs everywhere. There's, there's shit and piss in the streets. There's, there's homeless epidemic. There's, homeless veteran epidemics. There's, it's an economically impossible place to really build a business from the ground up at this point in time. This is why everybody's leaving. It's impossible to weigh their taxing people there. I mean, the exodus from California has been the greatest exodus of any state in any time and history in the United States history. And they're talking about putting this guy for president. His track record is literally shit. Like, what are we talking about here? And dude, here's the problem. That Michael Rappapur guy, they make, they make Gavin Newsom the President candidate. He'll vote for him. He's the option. Yeah, I know. He'll ignore, he'll ignore all the real world data of the state like broke. How do we not understand this? What he's done in California, he will do across the country. Joe Biden is trying to do what Gavin Newsom has done in California. That's where the buddy buddy. You got, oh man, it's frustrating, dude. And you know what? It comes from people being quiet. It comes from people obeying the social weapons that have been put into society like political correctness, silent majority, being afraid of cancel culture, not using their voice. You know, I get asked all the time, dude, everywhere I go, they're like, what can I do? What can I do? What can I do? Man, you can talk. You can use your voice. It matters. The reason why do you think they censor people? Why do you think they, they create these narratives and these, these cultural weapons like political correctness to get you to silence yourself so you don't offend someone with the truth? Why do you think that they make things like silent majority? They're afraid of your voice. So use it. That's the thing that we're missing here. Like, oh, I don't have a big platform. Dude, I'm talking about to your friends, your family, the people you know, like when you go to Thanksgiving next week and you know, they start spouting off about the leftists start spouting off about their bullshit, bro, you should look them in the eye and tell them to shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like, dude, they're ruining the world and you're allowing it. Actually, you're ruining the world. All of you listening right now who are not speaking up, not standing up, not saying things, not calling it out when you recognize that something's wrong, you are more of the problem than these people. You are more of the problem than these people because you're giving these people a pass with your silence. We can no longer give these people a pass. The people remember all your friends and family who attacked you and call you names and try to intimidate you for the last 10 years for having certain political views. Those people don't give two fucks about offending you or having some sort of confrontation or bullying you. So why do you care so much about bullying them back? Why are you afraid to speak up back to them? They will bully you into the earth. So bully them back. That's what we need. You need to stand up, speak up and use your voice relentlessly unless you want the next time this motherfucker comes to United States, he'll actually be the president. You know, this is ridiculous, dude. They're flying Chinese flags up and down the street. This guy should come here. He should never see a Chinese flag. He should, there should be fucking 50,000 motherfucking troops standing right there in his face to intimidate the fuck out of him to let him know like bro, what fucking kill you right here if you smacked if you run your mouth? It needs to. Yeah. Like bro, this should be a very uncomfortable place for him to come. Very uncomfortable. We're rolling out the red car. Yeah, sucking his fucking dick. They probably got him the best prostitutes of California to visit him in his hotel room. Like it's insane, dude. Yeah, man. Guys tell us what you guys think. Jump in on this conversation. Down to the comments, let us know hashtag a medical something nice. Let us know what you guys think. How would you feel if you're something a family who's lost a soldier or or or or or made sacrifices or have a history of serving this country and you watch and see our our literal political enemy in the world, our biggest threat in the world get welcome like that. That's fucking unacceptable, dude. Real shit. You know, I thought about this too because I saw this picture yesterday. I don't know if I wouldn't be able to confirm it. But I know it is a real thing. You know, think about the the Chinese immigrants that you know, I've came here for asylum because of the communism that they've escaped from China, right? Like there's a decent amount of them. Yeah. And imagine them watching this fucking guy who terrified bro. Yeah. Bro, we got like dude, the people forget that we got like they have Chinese police departments in this country. They we forget about that. Most people don't know that. You know, most people aren't even aware of that. Like most of our listeners have forgotten that the fucking surveillance state that he's putting in Cuba right now. Yeah, watch us like do we feel about that and we're rolling out the red carpet look bro. Here's the here's the real. Our government, our media has been compromised. Our president has been compromised. That's what all this hunter buying laptop shits about. It's treason dude. It's just it's what it is. And and this is this is going to this is going to become more and more common to the point where these dudes are going to be running our shit soon. Anyway, open me. Yeah, it's fucking fucked up man. Well guys, let's keep this cruise moving before we get to headline number two. Let's cruise the comments. This week's cruise the comment comes from Johnny Gruber. I'm assuming this isn't a response to you know, the lane kiffin old miss situation we covered on Q and A, but he says almost 56 and have missed one day of work in 25 years and blue collar work because we win and most men don't realize not showing up means someone else has to pick up your slack. Imagine being a grown man and act them like that. Oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's a big difference between someone who's been in the workforce for 25 years and a 19 or 20 year old kid who has never been told the truth about reality. They don't have somebody in the household. Yeah, but the danger is the danger is is that the people who have been in the workforce for 25 years are getting older and that while they understand this cultural reality of working, the younger people don't and and do it if they know if they don't figure it out, we're in deep shit and how I see this going, you know, these people have been groomed and indoctrinated. I think the plan I think the plan has been laid out much longer than what anybody realizes and I think they've known about what they're going to do with AI and what they're going to do with automation and what they're going to do with technology for many, many, many, many, many years. And the last, the grooming of this younger generation to be more so, I don't want to work. I don't believe in work. I don't believe in capitalism. I don't believe in hard work equals results or investing my time. I believe that's intentional because what they're going to do now is they're going to say, well, by the way, everything's automated and there's no jobs. So here's your little government check to live your life and in your utopia, except that government checks going to be, it's going to be like every other failed communist experiment that's ever happened. That government checks going to be so fucking little, the university basic income is going to be so little that everybody's going to fucking starve. And because there's no capitalistic environment inside the economy, there's nobody who is actually pushing to improve and do better and compete with each other. Like, let's say like for food, right? You don't have farmers, you know, working to outdo the next farmer next door and do better than them. We don't have actual competition. And we don't have competition that government runs everything. The supplies dry up and people fucking starve. And this is what happens. There's no, there's no, there's no luxury. Like, I feel like everybody, these young kids, they think like communism is going to produce a lifestyle like these Instagram fucking entrepreneurs post. You know what I'm saying? Like they're going to be rolling around free money with a fucking Lambo or whatever. And dude, really, you're going to have no shoes, you're going to have not really any food, you're not going to have any clothes, you're going to fucking not have anywhere to live. And the government's going to say, well, you're getting your universal basic income, be happy with it. You know, like they, you don't own anything. Yeah, bro, like be happy. It's very dangerous. Yeah, man. And, and, and, you know, you can see the effects of it. I mean, look, how many young people I could tell you this, when I was in my 20s versus the kids that are in their 20s now, there's an extreme difference in the work ethic, extreme different extreme extreme, almost polar opposites. When I was in my 20s, we all understood that there was a real competition happening in the world. We understood that if we didn't work hard, we would lose. We understood that if we didn't give our best, we would live a mediocre life at best and probably struggle our whole lives. We understood that very clearly. So we had motivation to invest in work and do things. And now we look at the kids in their 20s and what are they talking about? They're talking about, you know, living in some sort of utopia. They're talking about going to burning man. They're talking about, you know, getting a van and exploring the world and living a life like, cool. But like, here's the thing, dude, when you get to be in your 30s or 40s, you're not going to have shit. And you're not going to be able to create shit. And then you're going to be in this situation of perpetual slavery because that's what it is. You're going to have to work a job that you hate because you can't survive. And you're in this trap cycle. And this is why like these kids who are in there, you know, under the age of 20 or under the age of 30 in their 20s, being told, hey, your 20s don't matter, go, go do whatever you want. They're being told faulty information. The 20s are the time you lay the foundation for the rest of your life, bro. Like that's reality. It's not, it's not time to fuck off. Now I'm not saying you're going to have success. But I'm saying this is where you're going to learn your lessons. This is where you're going to build relationships. This is where you're going to set your platform. And then when you get into your 30s, you start to actually find success and make money. And then when you get into your 40s, you're going to see that you have some means. And you're going to be able to look at everybody else who bought into the, you know, I'm just going to cruise through life mentality because those people are going to be working at like a real, like they're going to be for, they're going to be a person who's in their 40s working at fucking, you know, T mobile, bro, like hating their fucking life and can't get out of it because, and they have to because they got to eat. And, and you know, this isn't like trying to talk down or scare anybody. This is just reality. Like if you don't work hard, bro, the result that you produce is going to be shit. And that mentality has been intentionally erased from a younger generation, in my opinion, so that the government can can move us into a communist, globalist type government system. And I think everything that we've seen for the last number of years has been the big moves to move us in that direction rather quick. That proof of it. Yeah. Absolutely, man. Guys, as once I thank you for being real ass fans, make sure you keep liking, commenting, make sure you subscribe as well and keep being real ass fans. So that being said, man, let's move to headline number two. This is an interesting one. And I don't really understand the move behind this. Maybe you can shed some light on this one. But Facebook Instagram will now allow political ads that claim the 2020 election was stolen. I don't like, well, I mean, the fucking was. I mean, I don't think I think anybody who has a ability to critically think at this point in time can identify the deception and the cover up that's been going on around this issue, the January 6th issue included, you know, where they're smoked, there's fire. And when you can't criticize things and you can't say you can't like dude, up until recently, you couldn't even talk about that. Like on YouTube, especially you couldn't even mention that. They would just take your video down. Yeah, so I mean now like be advised, this is a CNN article. Okay. So we know how they are seeing it is. But I see an article reads, meta will allow political ads on its platforms to question the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election, part of a rollback in election related content moderation amongst social media platforms over the past year ahead of the 2024 US presidential contest. The policy means that meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram will be able to directly profit from political ads that boost false claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. While a company will allow political advertisements to claim that past elections, including the 2020 presidential race were rigged, it will prohibit those that call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election. The change is part of a year old policy update, but has not been widely reported. The Wall Street Journal reported meta's ad policy change earlier Wednesday. So the past ones, yeah, okay, all right, cool. But the future ones, no, the current ones, there's no possible way those can be stolen. Can we talk about them after they happen? Yeah, look, man, I think this is kind of weird because look how this was, how this is written, right? The policy means that meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram will be able to directly profit from political ads that boost false claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Okay, well, what this shows to me when I read this is a separation from the mainstream media and social media kind of breaking apart. All right, because CNN is clearly still saying false claims where meta is clearly saying, well, we don't know, right? I don't think they were that false. Yeah, so it's interesting for that. Like a chick with Adam Zappel. But here's my, yeah, no, shit. But here's something, here's something to think about too, is if Trump's going around and these other candidates are going around talking about the presidential race being rigged in ads, okay? Well, there's a couple things about that. One, he's going to have problems raising money. Like if he's talking about the elections rigged, like, why would you give this guy money if the election's already rigged and the outcome's decided? You see what I'm saying? And then also, if we go around and, you know, which I believe they are, they are rigged in certain areas for sure. But if we go around and talk about that being the problem, that sort of demoralizes people from voting. Like a lot of, there's a lot of people out here that are like, dude, what difference does it make if I vote or not? And that's what happened in Venezuela, that's what's happened in these communist revolutions over the last. That's what they want you to think. Yeah, exactly. And so part of me thinks this is propaganda, they're allowing the propaganda intentionally to demoralize people from voting. So like, you know, give them saying, like, meta saying, okay, yeah, let them talk about it because all that's going to do is demoralize the the people in the center and the right from actually believing that they should vote. Yeah. And then on top of that, when you have these articles that seem to be putting now saying the right elections completely secure, now there's this fog of confusion. Correct. And like people are like, okay, no, it's definitely fucking rigged. They're saying that you know, I'm saying the opposite is true, right? Yeah. Yeah. You get into that whole monster. That's a great fucking thing. And you have all these people, these influencers out here saying, you know, your vote doesn't matter, you know, don't buy into the system. I'm not going to vote. Bro, you all are fucking idiots. Like, how are we going to catch them cheating if we can't, if we don't know what the true numbers are. Right. So like, even if you thought the election was rigged, you still have a duty to go vote for the evidence aspect of how, because we can look back at that later, potentially and say, okay, actually, this is the real outcome of the election. And if people choose to not vote, you know, we don't have that evidence. And then they win by default. Right. So, and that could go for either side. So it's super important that people understand that you have to vote, whether you believe that the election is real or not real or compromised or however you believe, you have to choose the best candidate that you think is going to create the best life for us here. And specifically, you here in America, that's the, that's the obligation for us going to vote. And it's, it's weird to me how people who I've thought were quote unquote intelligent are now talking about how if Trump's to candidate, they're not going to vote. So you, you're not going to vote because you don't like Trump, but you agreed that the world's totally fucked. And so you're just going to allow it to get worse and worse and worse. It goes back to my go, because you like, because you like DeSantis or you like Vivek or you like whoever like bro, everybody who thinks that Vivek is the guy or DeSantis is the guy. If Trump ends up being the guy, you have an obligation to vote for that man. Because otherwise the country's going to fucking burn. It will be a loss. Yeah. I mean, dude, we're going to listen four more years of what's going on now. There will be no America like that, that I'm a 100% confident in that. I'm a 100% confident. They will arrest what they're doing to Trump. They will do to every single person who fucking voted for voted for them. They will ostracize. If you thought like what they did with the vaccine was bad, where they started like pushing people out of the workforce. Dude, this next four years for anybody that speaks out against those people for anybody that voted in the opposite direction. Bro, they're going to persecute them relentlessly. They're going to take everything away from you. And for people like me and you and other people who are speaking up with a microphone, they put those people in jail or kill them. That's what they do. And that's where we're at. People have to recognize what we're actually dealing with here. This is not normal ebbs and flows of political discourse. This is a communist revolution that we are many years into. And we have very little chance of stopping it unless we unite and get really fucking smart. I think a lot of people are underestimating what's actually going on. They talk about like, oh yeah, man, it's not as bad as you think. What do you talking about? It's not as bad as I think. We have a literal invasion happening at the southern border. We have our strategic oil supply is gone. We have our military supplies in Europe. We have crime at one of the highest rates it's ever been. We have credit card defaults at the highest rate they've ever been. We have mortgage defaults close to the highest rate that they've been in a long time. We have an economy that's on the verge of potentially hyperinflation or total collapse. We have a pending world war with a military that's filled like legitimately with fucking people who have been held to a standard that is less than what it takes to go fight a war. You know what I'm saying? Like we do to like thinking that we're like 2001 United States right now is a fatal idea. Like thinking we're more divided than we're wrong. Listen, when you run a company, when you run a company and you've won, okay? And you've been successful at running a company and for those of you that don't know and you know me from this show, that's what I do. I run companies and I have a number of companies and all of those companies win. And some of them have won at such a large scale that at times, the people who work for those companies have started to believe that we will continue to win because we're us. All right, not having a realistic viewpoint of where we are in the game. And what that does, that's ego, right? We think, oh, we're better than we actually are. That causes a situation where you get your ass beat. And then you have to have a recorrection to admit where you really are. And so I think a lot of people, that's normal for me as an operator of business. Like I can recognize unemotionally, okay, we're here. When we're running at a level 10, I can say, okay, we're running at level 10. When we're running at a level five and everybody thinks we're running at a level 10, I can recognize that as well. And I see a lot of that going on in America. I see what I see in America is that we have kicked everybody's ass and been so prosperous and so free and so strong for so long that a lot of these people believe that we're still like that when in reality, we're in a very vulnerable position. And that's an important thing to consider when we talk about what's going on with the election. Because if these people continue to press, press, and press, and press, and press, and press, bro, this shit's going to come to your fucking front porch in a way that you don't want. And not in a way of like, you know, oh, this is it's a little bit harder right now. We're talking about total collapse of the country. We're talking about chaos. We're talking about you potentially having to fight people in your fucking neighborhood. Like this is danger. Shit where we are. And unless people truly wake up and unless people understand that we are not the superpower that we used to be right now. And that we have a job to do as individuals to become that again, you know, we're in trouble. You know, and that's a responsibility that we all shoulder as individuals. That's why I talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion. Like do do we do we really think that we have the men to fight a war like that? No, do we we are not in physical shape to do that mental shape? All the men I know that are able to fight a war like that are in their late 30s or 40s or 28. I'm just saying man, like all the bad motherfuckers that spent the last 20 years in and out, these guys are 44 years old. They're 40. They're 40 years old. You know what I mean? They're they're my clubbers age. They're not fucking they're not 25. They're going to be worried about their own shit. Correct. And bro, it's a big deal, man. Like we we are not the same America that we used to be. And it's important that we as individuals you as an individual become that person that fits that position that we need. Like it's real talk. I mean, you have to get fit. You have to become successful. You have to put good stuff in your brain. You have to care. You have to be a good representative of an American citizen and work hard in your communities and benefit other people. And these are real obligations that we have as individuals. And looking around and kind of like thinking that someone else is going to do it is where we're at right now. And that's not going to happen, dude. It's on you as an individual. Anybody listening to the show? That's real shit, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think. Hashtag, watch this. And tell us what you guys think about it. Let's keep moving to our third and final headline. This is a little mix of stories because it's all the shit that's been going on in the background where everybody's been focused over here. It's the shit that's been going on over here. So let's get into our third headlines. Headline number three. Chris Ray gets caught. Representative Higgins released photo of the secret J6 ghost buses. Now this is an interesting one. So on Wednesday, by the way, so I saw this video. They are circulated out of representative Higgins. Did you know that he used to be there? There's just like, bro, this video went viral so long ago. But it's a video of like this captain from the sheriff's department, right? And he's like literally, like he's got the whole fucking sheriff's department stand up behind him, right? Members of the community. And he's like basically threatening all the criminals and gang bangers and stuff in the city. He's like, we'll come find you if you want to have a tell some of me. It's come get me. You know where I That was him. Oh really? I had no fucking idea. But it makes sense. Like this dude's been a bad ass for for a long time. Yeah. And he's doing some really, really great work. Um, But just this past Wednesday, Republican representative Clay Higgins confronted FBI director Chris Ray on FBI operatives working inside the crowds on January 6, 2021 during the House Homeland Security Committee hearing on domestic threats within the US. This confrontation took place exactly a year after representative Higgins confronted director Ray for FBI assets working inside the Capitol on January 6. Chris Ray refused to answer the questions last year and today during the hearings today representative Higgins told Chris Ray, here's the video. He said he was communicating with his FBI handler while people were entering the US Capitol. Can you confirm that the FBI had that sort of engagement with your own agents embedded within to the crowd on January 6. If you are asking whether the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and or agents. The answer is in fat. You're saying no. No. You're saying not. Violence orchestrated by FBI sources or agents. Are you familiar with with you know what a ghost vehicle is? Directed to director of FBI certainly should. You know what a ghost bus is? A ghost bus? Ghost bus. I'm not sure I've used that term before. Okay. It was pretty common in law enforcement. It's a vehicle that's used for secret purposes. So it's important to identify when he says I'm not sure I use that term before. He knows exactly what he's talking about. He knows exactly what it is. Okay. So like if you guys are not like understanding what he just said. What he just said was and this is typical leftist shit. He's trying to control the language. This is what people do when they gas like you know exactly what that motherfucker did. He knows what he did. But he's saying on a technicality. Well, I've never called it ghost bus. Right. It's important to realize what he's doing. Mechanical. Whatever you know this motherfucker knows exactly what. Okay. Keep going. Well brother, all lawyers. I just do. And that's the whole game is this fucking this war of language. That's right. Dude, like they're all lawyers. It's highly manipulative. And it's borderline abusive psychologically type language. It's not peak. It's fuchsia. Correct. Correct. Correct. I didn't do that. Yeah. I actually did this. Exactly. Right. Exactly. When that and this are the same fucking thing. Same thing. Man. Yeah. Here we go. Law enforcement. It's a vehicle that's that's used for secret purposes. It's painted over. These two buses in the middle here. They were the first to arrive at Union Station on January 6th. 0500. I have all this evidence. I'm showing you a dip at its size. Mr. Chairman. These two buses. Mr. Chairman. Completely white. Point of order. As soon as we get into the good stuff. Point of order. Sure. Let's stop talking about it. Run over the time. I understand. But you'll recall that Miss Jackson Lee's been allowed to go two minutes before. I've been very fair in letting people finish their questioning throughout my 10 years chairman. And I'll continue to be fair on that regard. But I will make a note to the members if you could stay as close within your time as possible. We have a lot of people that want to ask these gentlemen questions. So with that, the gentleman yields. But your point. I've been very fair in this, Mr. Ivy, with everybody on this side of the aisle just as well. I don't think I accused you of being unfair, Mr. Chairman. You're making a point. Okay. Thank you. I now recognize. Now recognize. Now close this statement. Sometimes I think I think your time is expired. You see that? He's looking at somebody to give that answer. Oh yeah, yeah. Time is expired. I note that that other members across the aisle have been been granted time and I object. Welcome. I to my question being close. This is a very significant hearing, Mr. Chairman. And these buses are nefarious in nature and were filled with FBI informants dressed as Trump supporters. You deployed on top capital in January 6th. Your day is coming. Mr. Higgins, I now wreck. BMS, so completely destroyed them. And there's been other shit that came out like here's another video that was also shown at this hearing. I don't know if you guys saw this one. On mark state super vehicle two black SUVs, three state vehicle, state super vehicles, escorted four antipetra shuttle buses right here front center. There was actually five vehicles total. There was three front two in the back. They escorted right here. We did for them to get off their buses and then the state troopers unloaded and took their positions. There's that guy. So state troopers are escorting your teeth and buses into jacess. The ones up front too. They escorted in each one of those buses are labeled. They all pay charter buses. Look at that bro. Check this out. Watch. Here's the black SUVs up front. Wow. They freaking brought damn antifa here. They escorted them here. You got to be lights flashing. You got to be effing. Can you light flash? Hey, are you guys watching this while shit, man? While shit. Another stuff that's been making the news and I don't pee a lot of people have been covered. Is this stuff about this internet merger takeover by our federal government? So this is a rotors article. It reads US government aims to free up more wireless spectrum. So what they're doing is is that they are taking basically trying to push in this administrative arm that will control 2G 5G 6G when that comes. They'll wifi services right in the name of prioritizing internet for the entire company or entire country. Excuse me. They're calling it their national spectrum strategy. And basically anything that operates over 2,700 megahertz 2.7G. Anything that operates over that will have repurposing is what they're calling it. We're talking phones, we're talking laptops, we're talking TVs, right? We're talking anything internet vehicles, all of these things right for repurposing. Now a lot of people abroad in the whistle, chairs, Rogers and ladder denounced by an FCC's mission to take over America broadband services. They release a statement. House, energy and commerce committee chair, Kathy McMorris Rogers, and communications and technology subcommittee chair Bob Lada released a statement following the federal communications commissions vote to approve digital discrimination rules. Quote, the digital discrimination rules approved by the FCC are just another step towards Biden's broadband takeover. This move puts onerous requirements on our nation's broadband providers and will lead to government bureaucrats micromanaging America's internet access. It's time for the Biden administration to end this effort to enact more government controls, which will ultimately lead to higher cost and worse services for America. But it's even deeper than that. Even the FCC commissioner himself, this guy, Brendan Carr, he puts out a statement. He runs the FCC and he puts out this letter, says car opposes President Biden's plan to give the administrative state effective control of all internet services and infrastructure in the United States. This unlawful power grab chooses central planning over free market capitalism. He lists out a bunch of points in his argument. He says it's the last month Biden gave the FCC its marching orders. He's an actual order from the president. Do this. He brings up a bunch of different points. First point is that it hands the administrative state effective control of all internet services and infrastructure in the country. The plan sweeps entire industries within the FCC's jurisdiction for the first time in the agency's 90 year history. This has never happened. Never happened. It also allows the FCC to impose unfunded build mandates on ISPs and unlimited monetary fines on every covered entity. It adopts an expansive and disfavorite theory of liability that Congress neither direct it nor authorize the FCC to adopt. They don't even have the legal constitutional power to do any of this. In the end, the FCC could have adopted rules that lawfully and faithfully implemented Congress's decision in the infrastructure act. The FCC could have taken concrete steps that would have extended high speed internet services to more Americans. In fact, the FCC cites a few such actions in its draft order that were raised in the record, including eliminating government imposed barriers and regulatory red tape that have been slowing down broadband builds. But instead of going that route, the FCC opts for this ideological approach instead. To me, I think out of all the things, this is probably the most scary thing to me. Because I don't think, obviously like I said, nobody's really talking about this, but the amount of power and control that this would be giving. Not just the Biden administration, but just plainly the government. I don't care if it was Republicans or Democrats. That matter. This is the state. It's state control. This is state control. Yeah. And access. And bro, this, listen, we've heard this the state control media, right? Like in communist countries, the media is run by the state. You don't get real news. You get 100% propaganda. If you go to China, bro, and you tell Chinese people that you watch the Chinese news, they laugh at you. Right. They understand exactly what it is. The problem here in the United States is people do not understand what it is yet. And so how I read this, and I got some stuff to say about the January 6th thing too. But on this FCC thing, how I'm reading this is, you know, we have this lawsuit that Senator Eric Schmidt, when he was the Attorney General of Missouri, and a couple other state attorney generals put together that is now at Supreme Court level that is talking about the ability for the government to collude and censor through big tech. And it's also covering some issues in regards to how big tech is actually censoring i.e. traffic algorithms. You know, the things that we all hate, right? Like when we post shit, and you know, it doesn't go for whatever reason. Like that's a form of censorship, right? People don't understand that. They think it's not that you just wrote a bad part. It's not that they just, right? It's not that they just take your shit down or, you know, put a fact check on your post. It's that they'll just throttle the traffic and nobody will see it. That's censorship in itself. Right. And the reason that this has been allowed to happen, you know, there's two arguments. One, it was allowed to happen intentionally. They didn't regulate it intentionally. But two, the technology when it first came around, the tech companies like Facebook and these other social media platforms, Google and these guys got so much money so fast and filtered it right in the politicians that they created, you know, a favorable section 230 with very little regulation on what they can and can't do. And I don't think that anybody ever anticipated at least on our side, the average citizen, that the entire town square would be moved to these platforms. So in the beginning, we're like, yeah, that makes sense. They're a private business, you know, they can do what they want. But now that the entire conversation has moved to social media, these people have unlimited ability to censor, prop up narratives, remove de platform. I mean, dude, they're they're running anti like if you look at how social media companies run their platform, that is that is unconstitutional if it were the government doing it. And so when we look at what's happening here, this lawsuits at the federal at Supreme Court. And what I see this is I see this as Biden administration figuring out over the next 12 months because this could go to court any day, right? And get ruled upon this is a fail safe. And if they rule that the government can't do what they did in 2020 or during COVID, okay, these people won't have a massive tool that they were able to use to prop up narratives or squash narratives or censor any of these things. And so how I see this FCC thing is them trying to maneuver around that to take control of the entire internet so that they can run their play however they want. And that means like, you know, if I say the wrong thing, they can just shut my shit down. If I post the wrong thing, they can shut my internet on that not just social media page. Yeah, you're in an access altogether. Correct. And that's what they do over in China. That's what they do in other places. Think about this, man. Like, like, think about how how evil, how sinister, how fucking tyrannical you would have to be, right? Because we got to go back a little bit to that court case when it was first being tried out in regular courts. What's the first thing that the administration did? They filed emotions to dismiss it. Yeah. No, we want to keep doing this. Yes. So think about how evil somebody has to be, right? Like, I want to know who's idea, who's playing that was. Okay, well, we can't just control social media. We'll just control the internet. Well, who do you think it is? I know who it is. Who do you think it is? Rock Obama. 100% think he's when they came out. He 100% dude. Our country was doing very well considerably until until this dude came into play. Okay. And he he's the one that disturbed all the racial tensions. He's the one that created all this, this shit. And he's running the show right now. I mean Biden's not running the show. Everybody knows that even people who are Democrats know that Biden's not making decisions. We all know that Barack Obama's calling the plays. He talks about it. He talks about it openly in interviews where he's like, well, you know, I would never want to be president again. But if I could sit in my basement and, you know, have an earpiece and talking to someone, I would do that. That's what he's doing. Okay. So when we think about this, this play, and then we think about the J6 play. Okay. So when we talk about cultural movements that are designed to be weapons. All right. And I talked to you guys about political correctness. And it doesn't make sense. Like, what do you mean it's a weapon? Because they crafted a narrative in society where you're not allowed to speak the truth because it offends people's feelings. Some person you don't even know. Correct. So what does that do to us as individuals? It creates a situation where we self censored. And we condition ourselves to not speak the truth. That's the point of political correctness. That's why it started 20 years ago. Then when, you know, we look at what's happening with cancel culture. Okay. Cancel culture is a fear based social weapon that makes you believe that if you say the wrong thing, you're going to get attacked. You're going to get fired. You're going to lose your income. And a lot of people are here are afraid of that. So they don't speak up and they don't say things. And what does that? Who does that benefit? That doesn't benefit the people censoring themselves or the people being quiet. Then when we look at the idea of the silent majority. That's the nobility and correct. Then they add the moral superiority to being silent. Okay. These are all stackable social weapons that we've seen. And when we look at J6, J6 is just another social weapon that they have created to intimidate all patriotic Americans. Anybody who doesn't agree with what they're doing from to instill fear in them that if they go out and protest in the streets, that they will be arrested in sentence to 18 years. Like some of these people who were there on J6. And so in my opinion, when Chris Ray says, are you asking if like he tells on himself, right? Like what do people do when you accuse them of shit? Like think, hold on, hold on. When you ask questions to someone who's clearly guilty, what do they do? They usually respond like this. Are you asking that if I did this and this and this and this and this and this and that's what his answer was and right there in the interview, he said, are you asking if the only ask was like, do you know what a ghost bus is? And the motherfucker responds and says, are you asking if J6 was some sort of operation? Yeah, that's what we're asking. And it was. It's like, it's like 80. Did you steal the cookie? Are you asking if I ate the goddamn cookie? I have a cookie drawing. I was on the camera over. Yeah, these crumbs. These are not crumbs. Fuck out of here. Yeah. Fuck you do that. Like that's what we're dealing with here. We're dealing with people who are lying. They're not peak. It's fuchsia. Listen, yes. He's flat out lying. Okay. And this what J6 100% in my opinion was an operation, a social weapon, no different than these other social weapons we just went through that was designed to intimidate people from actually speaking up and having the the courage to speak up and go out and stand up so that they would have a free runway to implement all these things that they're doing. Imagine if people weren't afraid to protest because of J6 never happening over the last three and a half years. What would have happened? What would have happened during Ukraine? What would have happened during the vaccine? What would have happened during the for the migration crisis? It's the fucking invasion is what it should be called. Okay. What would happen? We have hundreds of thousands of fucking patriotic Americans in the streets and real real truth. That's what we need to have happen again. We have to they can't arrest everybody, bro. They can't do this to everybody. That's why they just they try to make a few examples. Yes, and scare everybody. Yeah. Correct. And dude, if we if we continue to cower because they run these initiatives and we continue to edit our language that is for political correctness, for feelings, the truth and reality start to fade away, which is what they want. They want the truth and reality to fade away so it can be replaced with their truth and their reality. And we're allowing that as American citizens by not exercising our ability to use our voice and our ability to use our voice. The walls are closing in on that. Okay. It's getting harder and harder and harder to speak up. And for us to like actually maintain what we've had here in America, which is the greatest country that's ever been founded for the citizen of the country in the history of earth. Have there been a depends on who how you're rating the success, right? Like I'm sure if you're the king of Saudi Arabia and you've got $100 trillion or whatever they got, you probably think your system is the best. But for the citizens, the the quote unquote peasants in every other country, 99% of every country that's ever existed 99.99%. The peasant class, that's the regular people. That's we the people. We have more rights and more upside in this country than has ever existed in the history of humanity. And if we don't utilize those rights, those rights will cease to exist. And that's why it's important that you guys not just speak up, but also live the example and confront the truth when you see it in real life. Like when these people come to you and they pull their shit on you, you have to you have to do your partisan American citizen and look them in the eye and say, no, I'm not going along with that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to pretend that's the truth. I'm not going to pretend that you as a man are actually a woman. I'm not going to play your game. I'm not doing it. Okay. And that's the resistance that we have to have. And as hard as that is as I'm comfortable as it is for some of you guys, it's a hell of a lot easier than having a shoot motherfuckers. It's a hell of a easier than starving. It's a hell of a lot easier than living a winter with no power. Like we have to consider the alternative to what's happening. And so the resistance that can be put into play right now is actually very painless compared to what it's going to be. And so it's important that people speak up and it's important that people stand up. And that's a real real obligation for all of us. Absolutely. You know, like I tell you guys all the time, you know, there's nobody coming to save this man. Like when you look at what's going wrong in America, you should look in the mirror. You should look in the mirror and say, what what am I doing? How am I living? What am I saying? How am I standing up? Am I standing for the truth or am I being a coward? Am I giving people a pass that that bully me around my standing up to them? Like we have to get back. We have to get like more kid rock and less dillum of aini, right? Like that's what we need in America. We need way more fuck you and way less give them a pass. Yeah, correct, bro. Stop laying down for these. Hold on. That was good. What? You hear us. You said we need more fuck you and not no less fuck me. Yeah. You get it. Yeah, I do. But what I'm saying is is look, bro, we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with the attitude that has always made America great, which is this fuck off. Okay, like you want to know the attitude that makes America great. Go look how Dana White handles a shit. Okay, go look how kid rock handles his shit. All right, that's what the fuck we do here in America. And that's been intimidated and beaten and bullied out of the average American man, especially and you men better find your fucking balls, bro. And like stand up to this shit and say, no, I'm not fucking doing it. And if they bully you and call you name, so what? Who cares? Who cares? The minute they realize it's like any other bully that you've ever dealt with in your entire life, the minute they realize that you're not going to put up with it, they fucking stop bullying you. Okay, it's like the playground bully that picks on everybody and yells at everybody and screams everybody and you knock that motherfucker's teeth on one time. Bro, they don't do it for the rest of their life. They remember that lesson. Their entire fucking lives and these people have been pampered and babyed and pacified and let's be real. These are the weakest people in our society. This is not just communism versus capitalism or left versus right. This is the halves versus the have-nots. And when I say halves, I don't mean money. I mean like a normal brain, a normal life, a normal mental wellness, like you're a regular human being versus like the people that we look at in the gas station are like, what the fuck? Right? Are we really going to like give the country away to these weak fat people who are literally couldn't contribute anything and don't contribute anything just because they're loud? Like we can't do that. You have to we have to get back to fuck off and when we get back to that, this whole situation will change immediately because the culture changes and when the culture changes, the politics change. Absolutely, man. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let me know what you guys think down in the comments. Hashtag governance harder. Yeah. And let us know what you guys think. But with that being said, that was our third and final headline. Let's get to our final segment of the show as always. Thumbs up. We're dumb as fuck. This is what we bring an article up to talk about. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or a dumb as fuck headline reads, Tiger Woods son Charlie accomplishes feet father never has in high school. This is pretty fucking no. This is pretty dope. So Tiger Woods son Charlie just accomplished a feat of the golf course, his legendary father did in this week woods along with his the Benjamin school teammates won the Florida State High School golf championship, which shot 78 76 in the two days of the FHS a class a state championship on Wednesday admission and resort in club and how he and the heels for them. The Benjamin school located in Palm Beach gardens had five total golfers and entornament, including the 14 year old freshman in woods. He finished tied 26th overall, but the Benjamin school is no stranger to winning at all as this was its fourth state title. Jake Valentine, a sophomore at a private day school scored birdie on the 17th hole on day two of the tournament as well as a putt on the final hole to clinch the title for the Benjamin school. He shot 72 76 to lead his squad to victory. The elder woods was among the gallery watching the state title play out. There was a moment caught on video to have a son holding out a chip just off a green that featured a typical woods fist bump in reaction. As a high school themself woods never was never able to collect a high school state title while at Western high school and then at home, California. However, state golf championships were not instituted while woods wasn't high school. So there is a caveat there. Andy, what we got? I mean, look, dude, this is an example of what I was saying about parents working with their kids. Okay, you can't get good. I don't care how genetically gifted your golf's hard. All right, it's really. It's a very difficult sport. And what's cool is that with all the success that Tiger Woods has had, he's the greatest of all time at his sport period. All right. He's taking the time to because like, dude, when we talk about reps, we're talking about time, thousands, hundreds and thousands of hours of time put into something, right? When when I look at this, I think it's cool. I mean, good job, Charlie. Good job guys at school. That's amazing. But what I really like about it and what I think is the real win is the fact that Tiger is legitimately putting in the hours and the reps with his own son to build greatness within his own family. And that's an American thing that we're missing right now. And you guys can say, oh, well, he hires coaches or this or that. Dude, he caddies for his son. I've seen this before. I mean, I don't know that, but like, even if he did hire, like, guess what? He worked his ass off being able to do that. But dude, all the lazy parents like dude, it's like that parent that we were talking about the other day was sour. Yeah. Who like get they get pissed off because South, South leaves here every day after work and goes works with Enzo at whatever he's working on. Like it's part of his daily routine, you know, but parents who don't do shit and sit on the couch and watch sports center and talk about the past that they could have thrown in 82. Have they not been a fat fuck and sit on the bench, you know, like these people are professional victims, bro, and they're lazy as fuck. And what I love about this is this is setting an example for what it looks like to be a good father and you could say whatever you want about Tiger Woods. Yeah, he's had his problems. Yeah, he's had his drama. Got that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's got whatever. But here's the reality. He's not failing his own fucking son. And that's a huge win. That's a fact. So I love this. Yeah. If we have more parents doing this for their own kids, the world, we would have a lot better off in the world. And I do, in all fairness, I do think a lot of people are realizing that this is a real obligation. I do, I do feel like a lot of young parents right now who are, you know, maybe they're eight years or 10 years into parenthood, they're starting to realize like this is a real thing. Like this is not something that we can pass off. And new parents, especially real, like I hear a lot from news parents who are like, fuck, I'm terrified. And I'm like, good. That means you're going to actually work to make this better. Yeah. Absolutely, man. Absolutely. So we've got thumbs up on that. Yeah. That's great. Well, guys, Andy, that's all I got. All right, guys. Hey, listen, man, this, for this to get fixed, you guys have to understand this is a personal obligation, a personal responsibility that we all shoulder, just because people come on the internet, like man and some other people and speak about these things, that's not going to get it done. And unless you backfill with your actual words and your actual conversations in real life and follow it up with how you live your life and how you live and perform in your life. And we're not talking about perfection. We're talking about legitimate commitment to being the best that you can, understanding that you're going to fail, you're going to have problems, you're going to struggle, but still moving forward. This is what creates the culture that we're looking to create. And if you guys bow out of that, and you think that because guys like myself or Rogan or fucking whoever is speaking up, and that's going to solve this problem, you're absolutely wrong. This problem is going to be solved in real life with real conversations. So when you go to Thanksgiving this next week and you're progressive, communist, fucking, blue hair, dumb ass cousin, starts talking shit, Beryam, okay, because these people have no problem bullying you out of your American birthright. And if you don't speak up and protect it, bro, we're going to lose it. And your kids are going to be slaves. So it's something to think about, dude, we all have, and we all have a responsibility in this mission. And it starts with sharing messages, maybe share the show or speak it up in your own words. Either way, that's what's got to happen. All right. So think about that. If we don't do this, we will lose. All right. Don't be a hoe. Show the show.
