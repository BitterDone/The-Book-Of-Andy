of that Ick you you know yeah I don't know dude uh but I can tell you this I would like it to be sunny until nine o'clock a night dude that'd be nice I like that that's my favorite time of the year dude when it like it doesn't get dark until like nine fifteen yeah bro that's the shit yeah yeah I feel like days were longer when I was a little kid man you know like you know like you know three routes of the street lights came on yeah what are you doing shit you know stuff yeah stuff stuff can't talk about stuff we can't talk about you know what was your what was your what did you like to put like what kind of games did you guys play when you were kids who so we had this one game where we would so like my where I grew up that it was an apartment on a hill I'm being seriously I'm I'm being dead as serious um and so there was like no my apartment for family flat there was an alley and then there was this elementary school next to me called gunlock okay and so my friends you know because we're on a hill like we have retained like this massive retaining wall right and then the elementary school was their recess yard which like drop fucking 30 feet yeah and uh so what we would do is we would like go up on our porch and usually every day around like you know after school about an hour after school we we call it the the crack evaporate because the crack had off the off the no they were like come by they just throw it off a 30 foot drop no we just throw shit at them oh okay yeah that's the gaming play bro and who could hit it and then we would run because they were fast they're all hooked up on bro I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm listen that's like 100 like 110 acting bro you you're asking me about my childhood I'm telling what we did we threw shit that crack kids man they were in for you guys didn't play games man no you didn't like that was it then we you know we take our bikes and stuff uh that we would you know get uh ownership of and we put like apples in the back so basically everybody's bike was a community bike yeah it was community bike yeah that's why we didn't care you leave them outside we didn't care we did that's a nice way to say it yeah yeah uh and you know put little plastic bottles in the back tire you know roll around like a little gang and stuff oh yeah make it sound like a motorcycle yeah you know my friend put it in his front tire once and then like that's kind of the same stuff we did yeah it's the same stuff we did it we did the same thing ride our bikes build like a little ramps and shit yeah you know and then uh we play a lot of baseball bro we would mattress flip you ever like do acrobat shit on mattresses that were like you know people threw out now and shit no yeah what did that's you well we play baseball regular kids do we probably played five million games of fucking baseball my back like that's all we did yeah play baseball every fucking day with tennis balls and a like a broomstick yeah there's a name for that like there's a name well there's there's cork ball is that what it is where it has like a little bitty cork ball it's like the size of a golf ball and then a wooden stick it's really hard to play okay because I've seen it playing with tennis balls and they burn them I don't see me like a torchum and stuff I don't know it's weird yeah it was awesome yeah but I mean you know like said bro I mean cultural differences it's same same yeah yeah all right well let's make some I was trying not to make any jokes today I'm proud of you today serious yeah it's good day tomorrow's joke day mm-hmm so let's uh let's get on with it hold them all in till tomorrow yeah that's right I got a lot yeah guys Andy I got three yoans for you man let's uh let's knock these out uh guys Andy question number one Andy whenever I'm stressed I numb myself with distractions strolling through my phone porn or drinking I'm fully aware that these things don't actually help but they're my default uh I want to learn healthier ways to handle stress but I don't know where to start how do I stop turning to quick fixes and start dealing with stress in a productive way okay well first of all this is a really good question because a lot of people struggle with this and I think if you put it in different terms it's very easy to make the adjustment that you're looking for and the terms that I would put it in is that you have to realize that you are losing the game of life to a fucking screen okay you are losing the game of life to a screen you are losing the game of life to women who have no idea who you are and don't give two shits about you you are losing the game of life to an inanimate object of alcohol all right what this means is that you have to develop discipline you have to develop the ability to recognize when it is you fall into this trap and how to get out of it so the answer here is twofold one it's awareness if you don't know that you're falling into these things they can capture you and you could get sucked into the vortex for you know half the day and you know that happens um but since you're asking the question I would say you're already aware that it's a problem okay so you've already conquered that that's a great thing the next part is is the part of action where you the first time that you think of it the first time that it arises the first time you're like oh shit I'm scrolling or I'm letting it distract me you need to get up and go do something that is productive towards your goals and the reality here guys is that the reason this happens so frequently to people is because they don't have a clear cut plan for their day all right they set a goal and they say one three five year goal and they don't actually break that down in the critical task that you need to execute on for that day and so if you have a plan and you have five critical tasks like we talk about in the power list which you can get for free it is the ultimate productivity method it's the only method that I know of and by the way it's free that will guarantee you that you get where you want to go in life guaranteed okay if you execute it so if you bring it back to a day by day by day plan now you know what you have to do and if you haven't done the things that you have to do you shouldn't be scrolling you shouldn't be drinking and you shouldn't be looking at porn okay um I'm not here to judge any of those things I'm just saying you want to get here you've got to eliminate these distractions because you're competing against people who have already figured that out and are giving all of their effort to this so you have to understand you're already behind because you're doing these things and you're competing against people who have already solved this problem and got it under control yeah so be aware understand how to recognize when this happens work on your discipline work to develop your ability to make the right decision when you know the decision needs to be made and it's not the thing that you want to do and you can use 75 hard to do it everybody that uses 75 hard uh and does it the right way they understand what I'm talking about this will fix that problem for you and then know what you have to do for the day and if you know what you have to do and you execute on all five tasks then scroll on your fucking phone okay like just understand it's okay to do some of the things you don't have to work 40 hours out of 24 man it's okay to do things that are a waste of time that you enjoy after the things that are critical to getting you where you want to go are checked off the list and so this is how you solve a problem like that um ultimately dude it should piss you off that you're losing the game of life to literal inanimate objects like that's like to me that's where my mindset changed all right when I was 350 pounds and I realized that I was losing the quality of my life to literally food and beer and all I had to do was to not do something to change my whole life which was mean not to reach out and put that shit in my mouth okay and that thought process like I can handle losing sometimes to somebody who's really good and really works hard I respect that but I can't respect myself when I know I'm losing the game of life to things that have no literal power at all and I'm giving them all my power so I don't know if you're wired like me but that pisses me off and that makes me want to you know get in control of my game and then you have to understand too guys that discipline is a perishable skill if you don't practice it regularly it goes away there's not one thing you're gonna do that's gonna develop discipline and then it's just gonna stick for your whole life okay if you don't practice it it goes away when you practice it it gets stronger it's no different than training for an event or training to play an instrument or training your body you're training your mind and you know the more you train it the stronger it gets and if you cease to train it it gets weak and that'll go on your whole life let's let's talk a little bit about stress right because he's mentioned in that like he does these things when he feels stressed how do you look at stress how should people look at stress like like what's the what's the the thing about stress nobody really wants to talk about uh that they're not actually stressed most people are stressed because they have anxiety about things that they know they should do that they lack the ability to do and it drives them crazy and then causes stress so when we think about like how stress affects us it's a very negative thing but the reality is is you're far less stressed when you're executing on the things that you know you need to do then you are when you're not doing those things and there's a basically like a paradoxal type of thought process here because people think that when you're stressed you need to take a break and then by taking the break it pulls you further from the things that you know you need to be doing which creates anxiety and creates more stress so it becomes a cycle that you can't break out of unless you actually go do the things you know you're supposed to do so that's what stress is really about for most people and I understand there is stressful situations there's things like you lose your job or you go through a breakup but those are temporary things those are things that happen to everybody um and that's called fucking life man and so life's not gonna be easy and also I will say that the expectation of being stress-free amplifies people stress level okay so when you start to expect that you should be able to go out and achieve something and then feel no stress the minute you feel stressed you get this amplification that happens because it's like the expectation is that I'm going I should feel good I should feel not stressed I should feel easy and this should be and I should be able to do this and not feel these things and then the minute you start feeling it you're like oh shit dude I'm so stressed there it is yes so do we end up in this in this cycle and the cycle can only be broken by having the proper expectations okay life is fucking hard building something is hard becoming something is hard creating something is hard these are all hard things and having the expectation that's gonna be easy only makes it that much harder because every time the expectation is broken you freak the fuck out all right so we have to understand that there's gonna be stress either way dude if you're gonna go down the path of working hard building something creating something becoming something it's gonna be fucking stressful and it's also going to be stressful sitting at home not being able to pay your bills or know how you can fill your car with gas okay so there is no path to anywhere in life that doesn't come with stress and anxiety and the expectation that's created by all of these you know internet wizards who know everything about everything but you know magically haven't done anything they try to tell you that you're supposed to go through life feeling peaceful and calm and all this shit will do to be real I don't know anybody that's built anything relevant to what you guys want to do with your lives that has built you know anything that you know we would any of us would say oh man that's fucking amazing that walks through life you know like Buddha stress free yeah bro because stress drives you to action all right most people don't do their best work until they have to do their best work they don't execute properly or at the highest level until their back is against the wall and stresses bearing down on them and then they have no other opportunity or choice but to act okay and this is what I call zero options mentality when you are a young person and you are not young in the game of entrepreneurship you could be 50 and you start out trying to build these things you don't have an option right now okay so you have to go out and you have to survive and then as you become more successful and as you start to make money and as life gets a little comfortable you have to trick your mind into believing that there is no other option but to execute you have to and that could come from a lot of different places that could come from putting extra pressure on yourself so that you do feel like your backs against the wall that could come from taking the focus on self I want to make all this money to the team I want my team to be successful I'm responsible for their families I'm responsible for their kids schooling I'm responsible for what they eat I'm responsible for what they live and as you as the owner of the operator when you take all that pressure put it on you think it makes you more stressed absolutely but do you think you produce better results absolutely so stress is not necessarily a bad thing it's just how you leverage it in the proper way and then understanding you're gonna have it no matter what you do in life I love it man I love it get let's roll the question number two Andy I'm always been the nice one the person who avoids conflict and goes along with whatever makes other people happy but lately I've realized that I let people walk all over me both at work and in my personal life I struggle to speak up for myself and when I do I feel guilty afterwards how can I start setting boundaries and being more assertive without feeling like I'm being selfish yeah like a true is this type B personality here I don't know what the type would be but I think we all deal with this at some point time you know um you have to be like a sociopath to not care about how other people react to the way that you react to them so I could understand how someone who is naturally passive and easy going can feel awkward about setting boundaries because I think we all struggle with that in certain areas of our life so here's the reality dude you are responsible for you and you are responsible for your actions and you have a right to set boundaries to where people cannot walk all over you take advantage of you and when they try to make you feel guilty for setting those boundaries you have to realize that that is a red flag for their character that's saying these people are trying to manipulate me they're trying to get me to do something that I don't want to do and doesn't feel good to me for their benefit and so when you start to set boundaries around things really what happens is the kind of shows you who's who in your life and a lot of people you know they never set boundaries and they do end up getting walked all over their whole life and I can tell you people to get walked all over their whole life they can't make any money they can't get successful they don't have respect from their peers and because they don't respect themselves so you have to understand that when you set a boundary it's not wrong you should everybody should have healthy boundaries everybody else has boundaries and one thing you should realize is all these people that you're afraid of hurting with your boundaries they don't give a fuck about taking advantage of you because you don't have any do they so you should think about that if these people were really good people they wouldn't press you the way they press you they wouldn't step on you but they're not okay most people have a human nature of how much can I get until they hit that wall of a boundary and that's where the respect starts so if you want respect and you want to be treated properly you have to stand up for what you believe when you believe it and you could do that in a very polite way you know this isn't mean like you said you know I want to be nice all right bro but you got to be nice to yourself all right and be nice to yourself starts with not letting other people step all over you because you're an easygoing person don't let your easy going natural uh personality getting the way of having healthy boundaries because if you do nobody's going to respect you so we have to understand dude saying no is a skill and a lot of times saying no you could say it a nice way but like if they're pissed off or if they have a problem or they get weird fuck them who cares yeah you got to take care of yourself first bro you could drive yourself crazy they're supposed to be there anyway then I think that's what I think yeah I think there's natural respect I think the best quality human beings can sense other people's boundaries without them having to be set and I think when really good people are starting to encroach on a boundary and they feel it they will say something like hey do you look I know this is a little bit extra but can we do this or can I do this or can I don't they'll they'll tread lightly because they care about your boundaries and usually they're reflective of their own boundaries so like if I'm gonna ask somebody something that I know they're gonna be a little uncomfortable with I'm going to acknowledge that up front I'm gonna say man look I'm not trying to make it weird but bum bum bum right and and if they say no you say okay cool totally got it dude I respect that but that's the way adults communicate and you need to learn that or you will continue to get stomped on your whole life and if you do you're gonna be at the end of the totem pole or the bottom of the total pole everywhere you go now I think I think a lot of times too a lot of people kind of build these monsters up in their head of like what these situations are gonna be like right now like for this person you know I don't know how old he is he didn't say but let's say like this has been him his entire life and he's just now having a start setting these boundaries can we clear the monsters like I mean what what would you say the percentage of people that are gonna respect him setting these new boundaries for the first time ever what's it actually gonna be versus what he might be thinking in his head I'm 99% of people are gonna respect it and there there's gonna be 1% of people that are like with the foot dude I thought we were blah blah blah those people aren't your friends okay and then here's the other thing you got to understand dude if you do not set those boundaries what ends up happening is is you end up bitter because you look at the world as the world is abusing you you look at the world as the world is taking advantage of you you look at the world as if they're they hate you and it causes you to get super pissed and the reason that you're super pissed and you feel this way isn't the world it's because you're not naturally standing where you should be standing on your limits right nobody don't give a shit about you like you give a shit about you well you know unfortunately there is a lot of people who are very selfless dude yeah there's a lot of people who are so selfless and so good that they allow themselves to be taken advantage of because they think they're not trying to rock the boat and you know they're like well you know so and so struggling with this or so they make an excuse for everybody and dude like I'll be real dude I used to struggle with this big time and you got a big heart dude yeah bro I care about people yeah you know and and dude like I've learned at this point in my in my life that like almost everybody almost everybody I'm around now is respectful but it wasn't always that way dude it would I learned that by getting taken advantage of for years and years and years and and dude saying no is a skill that is necessary for you to be a leader for you to be great at anything you do for you to be respected and most importantly for you to respect yourself okay if you go home every day and you look in the mirror and you're like fuck dude I let all these people step all over what how can you look in the mirror and respect that dude you can't it's impossible so we have to understand that respect for self comes first and respect for self comes from developing discipline doing the right thing executing on what we need to execute when we don't feel like executing on it and then having boundaries and saying no to things that you don't want to do and your life gets a lot easier when you get comfortable doing that yeah that's real man I love it guys let's get our third and final question in here we got question number three my question for you Andy is about business mentors how do you locate a mentor for background I am 25 I run a small fast growing business in the auto parts industry and I'm about five years in business I've started to get this feeling of no man's land I don't necessarily have a business mentor the closest thing for me for me is continually listening to your podcast and using the tips and advice to provoke my own thoughts and relate that to where I am day week period of time and business is there a point in business where you feel it's crucial to have a mentor or is it not necessary interested in your thoughts on this the easiest way to get where you want to go the fastest way to get where you want to go is to talk to someone who's already been all right if you're trying to forge a path to this destination that you've never been to it's like trying to cut the path through the forest with an axe it takes a long time it's really fucking hard it's really exhausting but if you can find the guy who's already been there that guy's going to say hey no no no here's the path bro and he's already cut all the trees on the way there and he knows the path so having someone who's been where you want to be is invaluable it's very very important that you find someone to follow even if it's passively following them meaning like you're watching from a distance that's what it was like for me okay we didn't have social media we didn't have the ability to you know learn from people who have actually built businesses I had to find people and sort of watch them and analyze them from afar and I'm glad it was that way because what it did was it taught me how to think I would look at someone I say I wonder why they're doing this I wonder why are they doing that how's this affecting that did they make the right to sit what if they would have thought that so it created this analytical business habit of thinking through all the options which I think today is probably my best skill I wouldn't have learned that as effectively is it is I did if I had someone telling me exactly what to do so you can have one just like you listen to me and there's other people out there who have done what you want to do I'm sure on social media they've probably done exactly what you want to do I would pay attention to what they do how they do it try to figure out why they do it on your own then I would go out and I would make an investment in your own education now people go out and they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a education quote unquote from major universities that are taught by mother fuckers that have never done the thing they are teaching and that's very much so how the internet is today too we have thousands of people out there teaching skills about how to do things that they've never done okay and in university it's the same it's the same shit all right so it's not the new for someone who's never done something to resort to teaching and then taking the money for teaching versus making a business that actually works so a lot of these internet quote unquote business gurus are full of shit and you shouldn't listen to them the ones you should listen to are people who have built actual things who sell actual products who have been doing it for a long time who have hundreds of thousands if not millions of customers who have employees who have built actual businesses who understand how to market because they built big brands marketing all of these things can be vetted out by paying attention is this person making all their money selling coaching or is this person coaching because they've been successful in other businesses one of them will make an amazing mentor to you the other one will be a waste of your fucking time okay so ask yourself qualifying questions figure out who you need to you know talk to and resonate with and learn from who's actually done the thing or something very close to what you have done right maybe they didn't run what do you say auto parts auto parts maybe they didn't run auto parts but maybe they ran a different kind of business that sold widgets and then they vertically integrated all the widgets and then you can look at that model and say well this will work over here all right so business doing business and talking about business is two different fucking things the internet is totally infested with frauds who charge money for things they don't know and you can't find their companies you ever notice that when you see these guys and they talk about all these businesses you you can't ever see them they're never there they're never they never at they're headquarters they're never they never show their actual businesses that's a red flag bro you follow me I'm here every day dude I'm showing you all the shit I got going on you know so you just got to be smarter than these fucking predators dude and there's a lot of money on the internet let me actually this just about you know because I mean you've been in business 26 years well hold on the the the point I'm trying to make here is there's two ways you could fucking learn from it you can learn from observation or you can actually get hooked in by making an investment in your education and the answer is you should do both yeah now let me ask you because you you have been in business for 26 years and I guess my question is more about like the evolution of of business transparency we'll call it right has it always been this way where you have you know these owner operators you CEOs that are so willing to show the deal right like was it always like that because I mean I don't know I mean you've been in business we mean always like that like we're business owners always so eager to share you know the past is owners usually eager to share yeah because they're busy running their businesses okay I'm probably want to fucking five people on the internet that actually operate real businesses yeah real talk yeah all right um now I understand you know there's ways to get started right I'm not knocking the kids that are going out there and and trying things and then failing and you know learning the pro learning how to do e-commerce and all these are valuable skills and you can do these things but what I am knocking is the 19 year old motherfucker that that thinks he knows everything about business teaching 17 year olds to do it or the guy who doesn't actually have an actual business but he's got a big flashy lifestyle and he's like okay let me fucking you pay me and I'll I'll make you a millionaire like do this bullshit okay so um I don't think that it's ever been in my 26 years it's just different bro like I had to read books about people and that's what I would recommend that you guys do like I read books about Sam Walton about Warren Buffett about uh Phil Knight you know uh all these different guys who were I mean dude I'm and I'm talking dozens and dozens of them yeah all these entrepreneurs and by the way war um Sam Walton's fucking you guys should all study Sam Walton that dude that dude was a true business innovator he was obsessive about being better everything that that guy did is really the the substance that creates massive success and um I learned a lot from him it was actually the first book I ever read it was like it was called uh the American way or Walton's way or some shit it was uh it was a great book and I read it when I was a kid I read it many times since but you can read dude about all these guys and there's tremendous dude I've read a lot about Trump you know like people said oh the troop going a million bro compared to what Trump built a million dollars is like if someone would have gave me a thousand dollars right um it's there's just a lot you can learn from from from the information that's out there dude and I wouldn't rely on AI I wouldn't a lot of the shit on AI is not even accurate dude you guys don't understand that like it's it's given information that isn't true and then you guys listen to it and it's not there I mean it's good for some things but I can identify things that you ask that are highly inaccurate because I'm an expert in that field so um we got to be discerning about where we take the information and there's plenty of information to either find a mentor or create one in your mind who is sort of like somebody that you look up to that you try to learn from that you try to emulate and uh you know I I would do all of those things I would read books obviously okay it's part of the live hard program every fucking day you should be reading something that is going to be geared towards pushing you down the road further I'm not talking about 50 shades of fucking bullshit I'm talking about I'm talking about stuff that you're gonna learn things from yeah right you should be reading 10 pages a day that keeps the mind stimulated it keeps you creative it keeps you focused on where you're going I would find people who are doing things and then I would like stalk the fuck out of them not like literally like I wouldn't show up their house legally yes I would read everything you can read I would learn everything you can learn I will watch every move they make and I would try to dissect why they're making said moves all right you can this is valuable because it teaches you how to think if if you're watching someone and they're making moves and you don't understand it you should be like well why are they doing that why did they do that because you know that the interest of them making that decision is in their best interest in their mind so what are they thinking why would they do that right that can teach you more than anything in my opinion because it teaches you how to solve problems and it also teaches you how to steal good ideas from your competition before they ever hit the market right there's a lot of companies that would be smaller than you that make really good decisions but when you're a bigger company you have much more audience you can look at that and say well that's a great idea and then when you do it it's going to seem like you did it first and that's something that is that's a whole nother topic because bigger companies do it the bigger companies all the time so there's a catch 22 there like you could do it to some people but they're going to do it to you too right but you know analyzing like we're talking about and then also you know spending your money on fucking learning more you know a lot of people are unwilling to make simple investments in their future like bro if you're you know a lot of these programs are 100 you know 200 300 bucks a month and you say oh my god I can't afford that bro that's two nights out a month the fuck you talking about you're not willing to stay home for two nights or three nights a month and learn how to get better so that you don't have to worry about going out to eat and looking at the menu or worrying about putting gas in your car like bro you have to make those investments and you have to equate them to what you're actually giving up like bro what are you giving up for 100 bucks a month one night out maybe what do you two pizza deliveries versus what do you stand to make that's what I'm saying bro like and there's lots of little programs that you can get into that can help you know that's what our tale is we we deal with you know small medium and large business owners who you know they pay a monthly fee and we get in there and we teach them how to do things and then they connect in the community so like you know I would be open to that I think that's a good thing if you're learning from the right people and if you're learning from the wrong people it can be a very bad thing yeah I love it man well guys that was three all right guys let's go out kick some ass we'll see you tomorrow CTI don't be a hoe show the show fuck a boat fuck a stone counting millions in the cold bad bitch who did slow got a own bank road can't fall does it know here's shot case closed
