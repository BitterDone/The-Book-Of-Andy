We figured we, you know, come in on Thanksgiving and record this this morning before you guys ate. Well, that's how much we love you guys. Well, let's be honest. You guys need you need some real action, some realist fuck enthusiasm. Yeah. In order to go deal with your family. Everybody with all these weirdos and like these people you never see and then you got to pretend like you're like, oh, I have and you know, you never talk to them and you're welcome. Yeah.

Don't be a hell show. But I thought in light of things given actually, you know, things given is always a weird time. Right. You go, you go to families. Maybe they come to you. I don't know. But, you know, everybody has that one liberal family member at least. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. And this things giving is going to be especially interesting because you know, they're coming off of a hard time for them. Oh, yeah. You know, and so I thought this was important. You know, this is a new survey, a new study that just came out that we go through this, you know, to kind of educate us. You know, and you guys listen to how to how to, you know, see certain things. That's very important. facial expressions that can reveal if someone is suffering from severe depression. They have like examples. They do. Okay. Can't wait to see mine on there. I know mine looks like it looks like I'm staring off in the space. Well, so doctors may soon be able to diagnose a severe form of depression simply by looking at someone's face. This type of depression called melakalia is marked by a complete loss of interest in daily activities and inability to respond to any pleasure, sleep problems, slow movements, speech and thoughts, agitation, restlessness, body aches and trouble with concentration. Now they developed this chart. When they say that if you see this chart, you see these facial expressions that that means that somebody severely depressed. So you need to be watching this while you guys are at dinner tonight. That was people look like, what about that one down there on the right? What's that? That lower right one. What the fuck is that? That looks like a growl. That looks like that looks like the fucking. This is real. That looks like zool from Ghostbusters. This is important. Do you know that? Joe? Joe, you know zool, right? Ghostbusters. The original Ghostbusters, the gatekeeper, the keymaster and zool. I know you don't know. You don't know any good movies. You probably think the real Ghostbusters is the one with all the fat chicks in it. What? Yeah. Well, if I had someone that looked like that, I'd be depressed too. I don't even make that face, dude. How do you make that? I don't know, man, but listen, it's important, man. You got to watch for these signs, guys. So look for them while you guys are bro. The funny thing is go back that left bottom left one, the smile with the mouth closed, the white people smile. No, no, it ain't. It's the fucking liberal smile, all liberal people smile like that. I get it all the time from watch AOC smile and watch anybody that likes AOC that all smile just like and they go like this. Yes, I call that the like every white person. No, they don't. I don't do that. Give me you gave me that the first. No, you do that when you don't know someone. Right. When you're walking down the when you're walking down the grocery store and there, I think it's a Midwest thing. Well, it's showing that they're walking like at use and then they look, yeah, because you are depressed. You're in the middle of the grocery store. Fucking everybody's being crabby. And then you see a black guy and everything costs. Yeah. No comment. There goes the neighborhood. God damn groceries. I'm in expensive. Mother fucker. He's still in all the fucks. This motherfucker will call me on the phone. This is true story. This motherfucker will call me on the phone. You'd be like, bro, you never know what happened at the grocery store. I saw three other black people. Oh, man. Yeah, man. God be curfew out there. Guys. God be careful. Yeah. So enjoy your Thanksgiving dinners. Let's get some to some heaven. Let's get to some headlines, man. We got some goings for you guys. Remember, if you want to see any of these articles, these pictures, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. We post all of them links for you there. And if you're listening on audio, come check us out on the tube. And let us know what you guys think. Well, that being said, let's get to our first headline. We have our number one. This is interesting. CNN, we'd like to be diverse here. We're definitely not one sided. I want to dive into this CNN article that just got released. The headline reads, Elon Musk publicized the names of government employees he wants to cut. It's terrifying federal workers. He made a roster. A whole raster. No way. Yeah. When president elect Donald Trump said Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would recommend major cuts to the federal government and his administration. Many public employees knew that their jobs could be on the line. Now they have a new fear becoming the personal targets of the world's richest man and his legion of followers. Last week in the midst of the flurry of his daily misiffs, Musk reposted two posts that revealed the names and titles of people holding for relatively obscure climate related government positions. Each post has been viewed tens of millions of times. And the individuals named have been subjected to a barrage of negative attention. At least one of the four women named has deleted her social media accounts. Here's the thing though. Although the information. Read this last little paragraph. Although the information he posted on those government positions is available through public online databases. These posts target otherwise unknown government employees in roles that do not deal directly with the public. So it's public information. Yeah. So he posted public information. Shit that's already out there. Yeah. He just posted it. Uh-huh. And now he's the devil. And he's the fucking anti-Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Elon sounds about right. Sounds about white too. But white spelled white tea. Yeah. No, but I mean the thing is though. You know, seeing them once opposed this and cry about these four people that, you know, in my opinion, you get posted by Elon bro. You should be thankful. You know what I'm saying? Um, but you know what's seen in does not talk about the fact that you got Trump cabinet nominees and appointees. They have been targeted with actual fucking violence and actual threats from fucking a lot of people. Nobody talks about that, bro. Um, this is Fox News article. Um, Hell on Reads. Trump cabinet nominees appointees target it with violent, un-American threats. The attacks range from bomb threats to swatting. This has all been happening in the last couple of days. Um, nearly a dozen of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees and other appointees tapped for the incoming administration were targeted Tuesday night with violent, un-American threats to their lives. And those who live with them prompting a quote swift law enforcement response. Fox News digital has learned quote the attacks range from bomb threats to swatting according to Trump vans transition spokeswoman and incoming White House press secretary Caroline Leavitt. Sources told Fox News digital that John raccliffe the nominee to be CIA director Pete Hexeth, the nominee for Secretary of Defense. Um, and representative Elise Stefanak, the nominee for the UN ambassador were among those targeted quote last night and this morning several of President Trump's cabinet nominees and administration appointees were targeted in violent, un-American threats to their lives and those who live with them. Uh, she told Fox News digital. Um, and uh, you know, they're not talking about that. They won't talk about that at all, you know, it's fine. It's they do it. You know, but Lord forbid they get a fucking tweet on, on Twitter. Um, you know, now it's fine if they do it. It's cool when they do it. It's a problem when I do it. You know, it's, it's crazy. Um, now we've talked, uh, even just yesterday on the show, you know, about some of these picks that Trump has been making. Um, he has another one. I feel like this was like the draft, you know, yeah, like the American draft. Yeah, like the American fucking draft. You know, it's kind of weird. But now for army, not fighting like NFL draft. It is kind of like that. It's like that, you know, uh, and for the number of night, I would be drafting a much better team than Donald Trump. I mean, listen, I think it's saying some of the maybe, maybe, maybe not much better. Yeah. But I would definitely, I just do to honestly, the more I think about it after yesterday's show, I don't want to get off track. I think he's shining a light on these people, dude. You know what it is? I don't know. I, I want to believe that I'm just not sure yet. Well, because like, we're gonna have to wait and see. We're gonna wait and see what he does that first 90 days. Yeah, for sure. But I'm willing to give anybody 90 days. It takes 90 days to really do anything. Yeah. You know, well, I mean, you know, because we talked about the, the surge in general pick, right? And her history and her stance, right? On vaccines, the double masking on kids, like all that crazy shit, shit that we're totally against the vast majority of Americans are against. But then Trump does this move. He nominates Dr. J. Say it. On the chariot. On the chariot. The co-author of the great Barrington Declaration as the new D new NIH director. So Dr. Bodhicharya, he's a staunch critic. He was one of the guys that got like, like permanently banned from COVID. Yeah. I mean, he was like one of the first ones sued on the medical medical side. The number one conspiracy theorist. Correct. Putting lives at danger. Correct. Killing your grandma. Yeah. I mean, that like that was him, you know, so Chema, you Dr. Bodhicharya. Trump put this statement out and he says, quote, I am thrilled to nominate J. Bodhicharya, MD, PhD, the service director of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Bodhicharya will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct the nation's medical research and to make important discoveries that will improve health and save lives. He obviously gladly accepted it. He says, I am honored and humbled by the nomination. And he says that he will deploy the fruits of excellent science to make America healthy again. And again, this guy has a record, you know, like I mean, and it's there. It's been there the entire fucking time he hasn't switched up. I'm going to show you a couple of clips. This is one from him with Tucker Carlson. Let's check this one out. The Stanford professor physician who specializes in this stuff seems like he'd be the last person you'd censor, correct? I mean, the key thing here, Tucker, that I think the folks need to know, what they wanted to do, and this I think is government actors and also some, so the, you know, old-vers, old media, old-old owners of Twitter, they wanted to create this illusion of consensus about science. That's right. That didn't actually exist. They wanted to fool people into thinking that we were following the science. When in fact, there was a robust debate among scientists about what the right thing to do was. And the consequence is schools closed, businesses closed, unvaccinated people lost their jobs because of mandates, even though none of the science actually, none of the persuasive science acts to support any of those positions. People suffered as a consequence of this censorship. And it, you know, of course, it's an abstract violation of my civil rights, my first amendment rights, but that's not the important thing. The important thing is that people, American people, were denied a debate, an honest debate. And I believe that had that honest debate taken place, none of those policies would have been put in place, and all of that suffering could have been avoided. The point was, yeah, I mean, he's been there. Yeah. I mean, look, man, I'm confused on how this is going to fit together with that other lady being picked. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. And that's what makes me, dude, this is what made me start, because I saw this last night. And this is what made me start to really think about it. Look, man, I'm going to call it as I see it. All right. If Trump starts doing messed up stuff, I'm going to call that out. I don't like some of these picks, but then some of these other picks, I'm like, yeah, and this is one of those guys, I'm like, yes, that's a great pick. And then I can't figure out why he picked this other woman. And the only logical conclusion that I can come to is that he knows that he's shining a light on these people. And by nominating and them firing them, that's a way to get them out real easy, right? Because they're all going to take the job. Oh, yeah. So how would you get them out if you didn't nominate them? And then what would the reason be to get them out? So there's all these little, I mean, dude, look, this is a, this is a huge chess game. You know, I really think we're going to have to wait and see. That's a great point. I mean, I think a lot of people, I mean, us, you guys listen and include it, man, like, this is a massive game of chess. And it's not like, this is like 4D fucking chess. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Nobody knows all the fucking moves in the play. Well, we don't, we don't, yeah, there's a lot of, right. There's a speculate all we, all we have is the information available to us, which is limited. Yeah. And, you know, I think it's hard. And I think it's ignorant for any of us commentating out here on podcasts or on the internet to believe that we have all the information. And I think a lot of times people, including me, make conclusions based upon part of the information, I just happen to be right most of the time. And the reason I am, I'm not saying, I'm not, that's not a smart ass comment. But that's what I do for a living, right? When you run companies, when you build companies, when you, when you, what you have to do is you have to be able to see corners that nobody even knows are there yet, right? Like, it's not like, you know, you got to see a little bit ahead, you got to see way ahead. And so I'm used to doing that. And I can make, you know, good conclusions based upon limited data. But still there's data in this situation that we don't know. There's things that don't make sense. And usually when things don't make sense, it's because there's something we don't know. And that's where I'm kind of at right now. I'm not going to be the guy that's going to jump all over Trump like I know better because I'm not in that situation. That would be the same thing as him walking right into this building and saying, you're messing this, you're messing that up without me knowing, without him knowing the intricacies of how we even got here, right? So I keep that all in mind, you know, there's a lot of people online right now that are like totally trash and Trump. And you can have your feelings. And there's a lot of people who are blindly supporting Trump. I don't think either one of those is a good place for us as Americans to be. I think we have to be called the balls and the strikes, right? Like, that's a good, that's a good play. That's not a good play. Just like we were watching athlete. He did good there, right? There he sucked. Okay. And I think when we start evaluating these actions that these people are taking in the public eye, you know, that way we're in a lot safer position as individuals, meaning we're not going to get sucked into this group thing. We're not going to get sucked into this division. We're not going to get sucked into left, right? Gay, straight, black, white. I think one of the biggest problems that we've had as Americans is that we've all allowed ourselves to get sucked into these little subgroupings of identity politics, which has created a conducive atmosphere for them to divide us and then get what they want. And I think it's important for anybody who, whether you support Donald Trump, which most people do, and I know a lot of people are excited, or whether you don't support Donald Trump, I think it's important. No matter what, no matter who you like, no matter what you like, that we call the balls and strikes the way that they are delivered, right? Like, this is a good one. This is a bad one. This is a good one. This is a bad one. No one makes 100% good decisions. No one in a company, no one at home, no one as president. So we're just going to have to wait and see. I know a lot of the people around Trump, they're smart people. I don't really believe that they don't know that some of these people were part of the problem. And so then I just have to ask, well, then why are we do right exactly? So I don't know, man, we're going to have to wait and see. And that's kind of where we're at. You know, it's a wait and see thing. Well, I think that's the important other part of it too, is like, we also got to keep in mind he's not in office yet. Correct. And so it's like, you know, you can't show all your fucking cards. No, dude, even when you're in office, right? You can't show all your cards. That's a huge dude. Listen, what you just said is a massive truth that people don't realize. He cannot, it's November, bro. He cannot say, I'm going to go in and do this. I'm going to go in and do that. I'm going to go in and do this. If those things are considered extreme right now, because it'll stir up everything. When he has no power to do anything about it. Correct. And that creates more resistance. Like don't think that he's not being very, very quiet in order to keep the waters calm until he gets in office. And I mean that in a good way. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that in the context of he's going to clean up what's going on. I still believe he's going to do that. And I could be wrong, but I believe it. And I think it's, it would make no sense for him to say, I'm putting these people that did COVID and fucking prison forever. And I'm going to hold these people right now because it would create a shit storm that could potentially lead to a third world war. Okay. So if he brings the hammer right now when he doesn't have the power, that's not good strategy. If I was advising him, I wouldn't advise him to do that. I would advise him to play it real cool. Well, I mean another example of that. I mean, we like very close. We talked about this with Greg and Greg, but it's like, I mean, shit. I mean, Russia's launching these fucking missiles. You got all this Trump has in common and on many of that. Yeah. Well, no, I think he's been, I read in a couple of different places that he's been in contact with. Yeah. I'm saying, just making public statements. Yeah, I don't, I don't even need to mind why would you? But to your point, though, yeah, he's playing it like, right, not trying to like do anything. No, you're easy right now. He's calling up Putin saying, hey, man, don't do anything. Yeah. And if you do, at least take the fucking warhead off of it. Yeah. Don't do anything. When I get in, I'm going to fix this. Yeah. Just hold off. Do the minimum, like he's trying to deescalate the situation behind the scenes 100% man. That's my take. Now, I mean, I'm excited, man. I don't want you guys to think that I'm not excited. I mean, look, dude, nobody's done more content on this than us. Nobody. All right. I committed and DJ committed a long and our guys here committed four and a half years of our lives to putting out content about this. This is not our expertise or our passion, right? Like we're a business entrepreneurship type people. That's what we want to talk about. And I don't know, I guess it is now, but you know, I'm excited, man. It's just some of the stuff doesn't make sense. And I don't ever just like throw my full belief in trust behind anybody. It's not what I'm about. You know, I think that's where you get hurt. That's where you get burned. When you when you trust someone like that, yeah, that's where you get that's where you get burned, bro. No, I mean, one percent, man. I think, you know, another thought provoking development that has occurred enters the chat is Catherine Harrage. This lady right here. Okay. Now, Catherine Harrage, she's an Emmy winning investigative journalist. All right. She's a coordinator bio on Twitter. She says she's telling the stories I could not tell before where the facts have a power all their own. She she's pretty cool. She has an interesting take and interesting story on some stuff that could bring in some big weight things that we've covered on the show when it was uncomfortable and not poppy with a cover. I want you to watch this clip from Catherine Harrage. Let's check this out. We eventually broadcast the story about the Hunter Biden laptop after the midterm elections in 2022. We commissioned a forensic review. I got a copy of the laptop data. I have it. I have it here still. I went to a lot of effort to get the cleanest copy of the laptop data, the same data that was provided to the FBI because I didn't want to have any professional journalistic risk for CBS news. I wanted this thing to be totally locked down. When we did the story, we did it after the midterms. I argued against that because it was ready before the midterms. And my training is that you should always do the story when it's ready to go. You should not be dictated by the political cycle. Once we got the laptop story on the morning news, I felt that there was so much there that we could still do. For example, in the text messages, there's unfortunately the use of the N word, the liberal use of the N word. And I thought this was worthy of a story, but I was told that it was not something that interested CBS news. Then I asked for forensic review of the laptop and we found that there were more than half a dozen emails that were likely used by Joe Biden. I thought that was a story, but the answer that came back was, well, we need to know what the content is of the emails. But that was going to be a year's long process. So there was no way. So there were just there were a lot of reasons I was told not to do it, not to pursue it. So we had sort of files. Yeah. Now we got Catherine Haritch reports. Well, I mean, like, you know, why didn't she why wasn't she more vocal about this when this was going on? Why? And why now after Trump's back in office quote, you know, are on the, you know, he's present elect? Why all the sudden you coming out now? Okay, because you had an obligation if you, you know, claim to be the ethical journalist that you claim to be a U.N. obligation to come out with that then and you didn't. So I don't buy that shit. I'm sorry. You know, saying, oh, I'm this, I have integrity in CBS and I'm, I'm a great journalist and I do things the way it's supposed to be done. Well, no, you didn't because you had information that was relevant to all kinds of events going on in the country. The country's being destroyed by these people and you just let them tell you no. That's that could have been a massive story in itself. The walls that they put up to keep active journalists from actually covering real stories. I want to see Biden drop the Joe Biden drop the hard on. I want to see it. That is a story. You know, I'm saying, I mean, look, dude, these guys are world class pieces of shit. Nothing's just surprise anybody. Yeah. And now you want to come out and fuck. Yeah, I just don't like that. Like, like, you know, yeah, I get it, dude. You got, you got censored. You got walls put up. You were told not to do it. But sometimes breaking the rules is required. Just like when, you know, police were told to arrest people who were on the beach. They shouldn't have done that. And 99% of cops agree with that. All right. So there becomes a time and place where we as citizens and patriots and people who care about the United States and its people do not listen to orders and we do the right thing. And you didn't. So you don't get to come out now and say, uh, when everybody's on the hot seat, yeah, it wasn't in my fault. It was your fault. In fact, I think it's more your fault than most people because you're the one with the information. Yeah, I agree, man. I agree. Guys, tell us what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know your thoughts. I like that, dude. Yeah. It feels like a rat jumping the ship. It's a lot of that happening, man. Yeah. I think it's gonna be a lot more of that happening. Yeah. I knew I was, they told me no. Yeah, you probably went in there and said, you know, I don't think this is a good idea to run before the midterms because that way, you know, like y'all ran on it. Everybody remembers. It was a united front. Yeah. All these liberal media outlets were in on it. 100%. There's no listen. You could have spoke up. You couldn't went to James O'Keefe. You could have went on Twitter. You could have went to Elon. You could have went and done a lot of things that you didn't. All right. So don't come now after the tide has turned and pretend like you're on our side of things. You weren't. All right. You were the same mother fuckers that were telling us we need to go to camps and not participate in society. What's going to happen to all these people during COVID that said that, you know, we should be excommunicated from society and we don't know what we're going to do with the unvaccinated and, you know, don't talk to your family and like all of this shit that they told us what's going to happen to those people? What's going to happen to the people who shut the schools down for two and a half years? You see what I'm saying? There needs to be accountability for this dude and like you don't get to jump. What's happening here is she's trying to dodge accountability that she's afraid might happen. That she knows is going to come. I mean, whether it comes or not, we don't know yet, it needs to, but she's trying to get out of the way. Yeah. God, so it's what you heard that lady before. Never. I've never heard. Exactly. Never seen her. But yeah, my God, tell us what you guys think down in the comments with that being said, let's go cruise some of these bad boys. Yeah. A lot of people love the sweater. Did they? A lot of people love the sweater. I want the sweater. You want the sweater Friday 11 AM. That's tomorrow at 11 AM. You might get one. They're very limited. Andy sweater is chef's kiss. Where it is.

Was that, yeah, I mean, Trump's really not going to be that bad for the country. Like another, you know what I'm saying? Like, you guys still be fine. That's how I took it. I don't know. But she spoke directly to her. Well, she's responsible for these people freaking out. There she is. Like, dude, these families that are at least people who killed their families and they're freaking out. No, no, I'm saying like imagine like it's because of her. It's her and Biden. They told everybody in the media that he's Hitler. He's going to bro. Joy Reed still saying the shit. And so it's, uh, fucking alien from the view, uh, whoopie Goldberg. Yeah. She looks like the fucking alien, bro. Like imagine your predator. Imagine she looks like predator. That's what my call her the predator. She does. But like imagine your comla, right? And you're doing all of this and you listen to your advisors. And you know, you go out there and like, he's Hitler, right? And come back to like, how did that go? Like, how do they take it? Uh, well, the sky just killed his fucking family and then it's like, dude, dude, you do what? Yeah. Shit. Yeah. Dude. Fuck, man. Um, but yeah, so she comes out, man. Bro, these people wreaked havoc on the country for the last four and a half years. Well, well, I mean, dude, I don't know if you've seen that there's a map that showed that literally every single state, uh, the Republican numbers have grown in every single fucking state. Yeah. Not only state she won were the ones that didn't have a idea to vote. Mm-hmm. Um, but yeah, so she made this, uh, she made this, this video. She did like a little, uh, grass roots calls, what she called it. Um, I think she had Tim, Tim, Timmy Walls on their tampon, Timmy up in there. Let's check this clip out though. Um, for those of you who have not seen this yet, um, here are 30 seconds of Connolly. I just have to remind you, don't you ever let anybody take your power from you? You have the same power that you did before November 5th. Mm-hmm. And you have the same purpose that you did. And you have the same ability to engage and inspire. So don't ever let anybody or any circumstance take your power from you. I can smell the alcohol on her breath. I am playing, bro. I can smell it. She is fucked up. Not only is she, I watched the whole 10-minute video. It was way worse than this. How would you like that? Because I wanted to listen. I want to make sure that we're not always like them. Sometimes we could be like them. But not always. I wanted to know the whole video or was it just a 30 seconds that was bad? No, it was the full 10 minutes. And dude, let me be real here. Let's look at her face. She's been drinking the whole time. Bro, since like, I don't know. She slept since then. Bro, she looks like shit. Bro, look at her hair. I mean, fuck, it's all bad, man. Dude, everything about her. Everybody's been clowning her. Yeah, well, she deserves it. A, B, you just said drunk onto your thanks, give it. Facts. Facts. Bro, he's funny. Oh, he's wild. He's what he is. But, you know, leave it to the internet. We don't get him on the show. Let's do it. Yeah. I mean, he might like run out with a shirt off. I don't fucking care. I mean, he'll come back. He'll come back. Yeah. He needs to press. But, uh, leave it to the internet, man. Internet's a great place. It can be a great place, you know. And people and their skills and abilities. Oh, wild. Yeah, let's watch this. We've got some funny clips. Shot time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I thought that Kenny is good. Okay, let's try this one more time. Whoa. Okay, last one. Is that a guy? Oh, damn that. Is that a backwards? You know, they got it with the backwards and Hennessy. This is another girl. Check this one out. I just have to remind you. So don't forget this is this is accurate. You have the same power. This is the kind of speech you would get at a shitty ass karaoke bar. And you have the same purpose that you might cause. And you have the same ability. Oh, man, she's a fucking mass, bro. Yeah, okay. I've seen that situation. That's what I'm saying. This is a real situation. Somebody's uncles up there, fucking singing bad to the bone and shit. Like I've seen it a thousand times, man. Yeah, because you were that uncle. I was singing. Yeah. You know, but it's funny. She looks like shit. Dude, well, it's funny. You say that because the body language expert, he says, body language expert reveals the truth over flasit, Kamala Harris's rambling, blirried, I'd video message. He said, uh, the video clearly demonstrated Harris is great difficulty in expressing honest human emotion. Now I agree with that full circle here. Yeah. Stay with me. Stay. Look, stay with me now. Which is. Which is. Which one. I see it's the fucking top left. The dimpler. The dimpler. The dimpler. I see a little dimpler in there. You say top left. Yeah, she's raising her cheeks up there. She grazer. Yeah. Bro, look how her one eye squinted. Like you know, listen, that's drunk. Hold on. How fucked up do you got to be to be looking at one eye? Oh, you're pretty. You're pretty. You're You are fucking hammered. You're feeling good. Yeah. When you started doing this shit. When you started doing that one-eyed shit, bro, why are there two cameras? I thought we said one. Bro, you started doing that one-eyed shit. Bro is time to go to bed. Time to go to sleep. Yeah. Bro, Fuck man. Oh man. Now in other news about this because there's there's other shit that's always coming out. Did you see this Harris campaign advisor David Plough accidentally exposes how legacy media lied to the American people with junk polls. We call them. Shocking. Hold on. I'm so shocked that that woman wasn't actually beating Donald Trump in the election. Ever. I'm so shocked that it wasn't even close. I'm so shocked that she was at 27% when they made her the candidate and she didn't actually go to 50%. That shocks me. I mean, I can't believe it. Let's hear it. Now let's check this out. This is Harris campaign. This is Democrat strategist James Carvill. Let's check out what he had to say. When we got in, my recollection is some of that snapback, but we were behind. I mean, I think it surprised people because there was these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw. It was just basically a race that in the battlegrounds was 46.47. 47.48. That's not where we started. We started behind. She was able to climb out. I think even after the debate, we might have gained what 0.51. It wasn't a race that moved a lot. I think when you think about our own internal analytics, if you have Wisconsin at 47.47 or Pennsylvania 48.47, Trump, let's say, which I think is where we had it at the end, you've got to have undecided, break your way more than your opponents, and you've got to get a little benefit from turnout, which we weren't able to do. I was right. I was right. You were wrong. I was right. You were wrong. Fuck you. That's my new one I'm working on. When we got in, can we make a beat out of that dude? Can we make a song out of that? I'm pretty sure we can. Gilliamatracks. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's it's funny. Now last little thing, at the band play. Really? F Studios. I was right. You were wrong. Fuck you. Fuck you and you. How about that rhythm? Hey, here's the deal. Sounds about right. Yeah. Yeah. I'm calling the first album raisins. Listen, bro. No shit. Yeah. Right. Man. No shit. I feel like there was these two dudes, Ebony and Ivory. Ebony and Ivory. They're together. You know the thing. Yeah. I do. That's a good song. Anyway, there was Ebony and Ivory. These two dudes and they said this on their podcast that the polls were fake and everybody said they were stupid. That's crazy, man. They might be stupid, but not for that. Not that. They missed on that one. Look, man. Why do they do it? Why do they do that? So they could cheat. Okay. And why weren't they able to cheat? Because America. Because America. But also. No, for real. Also, people were prepared this time. They were looking out. We had tons of lawyers on the scene. We had people going to the polling stations during election to make sure that shit wasn't happening when that stuff was happening in Pennsylvania. People were there like within 30 minutes, right? Like the fuck restarted and then people were there. And that's what's that's what's required. That was what was required. So, you know, but I think people should be very mindful to understand that the reason that they wanted the polls to be close and the reason they spent over a billion dollars on media hyping her up was because they planned to run the same play that they ran in 2020, but they couldn't. All right. So, yeah, I mean, it's nice to hear someone actually saying from their side, yeah, saying what they did. Yeah. Now, if you think drunk aunties polis couldn't get worse, let's go to the White House real quick before we get to our third and final headline. Joe Biden, they just received the Christmas tree, but there's a problem. Okay. Imagine, imagine getting the, okay, imagine getting the Christmas tree. Okay. Now, we know we talk about the devastation that happened in North Carolina, right? The crazy hurricane that went through. There's a lot of people still affected. A lot of trees fail. Oh, there's still hurt. Fuck it, right? They still haven't gotten help. Imagine taking one of the only trees left from that area. I shut the fuck up. What they do. They took the only fucking tree left from that area. No, it's not the only tree left. Check this out. This beautiful phrase you're for was grown at the Cartners Christmas tree farm where the Cartner family has been growing trees for more than 60 years, and their farm is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, a region that was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene. The Cartner family lost thousands of trees in the storm, but this one remains standing, and they named it tremendous for the extraordinary hope that it represents. It's an honor to be here today with Congresswoman Virginia Fox, as well as members of the North Carolina National Guard. You know what's even worse about that? They don't even pay for the fucking tree, man. Bro, you know they know. No, they probably have a budget, and they probably throw a billion dollars at it, and the fucking Christmas tree farm didn't get any of it. No, yeah, Christmas, it's, there's no money in it at all. Yeah, you know what would have been cool? You buy their last Christmas tree and then pay for the replanting of their entire farm. That'd be cool. Yeah, that would have been cool. How about that? You guys are fucking rich. You could have fucking done that on your own. You know what would have been cool? Here's what would have been cool. This is what I would have done. I would have, first of all, I wouldn't have cut the tree down. I would have left the tree there, and then what I would have done is I would have said, our tree this year is this tree, and it's here at this farm, and it represents hope, because we're going to replant all of these trees. And I would have taken everybody from the White House and everybody from the press core and everybody, and we would have went there and we would have decorated the tree and we would have made a huge deal. And then I would have personally wrote a check to the farm and said, replant your farm, not taxpayer money, my money. That's what I would have done. That's the right thing to do. And then bring, you know, get something else for the White House, right? They're trying to be, they're trying to be iconic here. It's wrong. First of all, let's cut down the last remaining tree. That's fucked up, man. It's fucked up. Let's fucked up. Light comular hairs. Now we all are going to agree new deal. Let's cut down the tree. Fucking idiots. Yeah, man, guys, jump in on this conversation, man. Let us I love that all these people's bullshit is just so hypocritical and crumbling in their faces. Right in front of it. I love it. Oh, they've been getting lit up. Listen, that's when you live in house of cards, eventually falls down. Look at those Clydesdale's, man. Those are beautiful, beautiful, bro. You should get some Clydesdale's. I want some. Let's for real. Let's get some. I don't want to take care of them. I want to do the work. What? What do you do there? I don't know, you got to do a bunch of stuff. Take care of horses, bro. They're not like, they're not like an easy thing to have. You got to like, they're like dogs, bro. You got to spend time with them. Is shit. Oh, okay. I don't want the one thing I have is not time. Yeah. Can we, I just want to ride one. It would take that for you to ride horse. All right. All right. Okay. All right. All right. And we'll be thankful today. Yeah. All right. I'm thankful for Clydesdale's that way. That way you get to be included in horse riding. That's fucked up. Yep. Yeah. Guys, man, check us. Let us know down in the comments, man, what you guys think of that being said, a third and final headline at line number three. That would be cool. Guess what Clydesdale's probably fucking sick. Yeah. Let me be sick. Here at Anisar Busch, the history. Let me be sick. Yeah. Just say Lewis. Be good content. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Number three. This is, this is one's a doozy. Do you see this? Eagles fan. Tons LeBron James with Diddy Parties Chat at Rams game. No. Oh, buddy. Fast and you see, bro, it's for this one. LeBron James didn't get the warmest welcome from one fan who taunted him about Sean Diddy Combs during the Rams Eagle game on Sunday. And a fan captured video that has made his way around social media. Someone can be heard yelling in James's direction while the Lakers star setting a private suite at Sofie Stadium in Inglewood. Let's check this clip up. Holy shit, dude. That's funny. Bro, do you see the lady's face? Oh, bro. Yeah, she's upset. He's trying to ignore it. Right? No, listen, we need to listen, dude. Let me tell you, you don't look at the hecklers, bro. You got to ignore me. Oh, no. Like even if you're family, like this is a message to all my friends and family. Because I've gotten heckled. Yeah. Don't look at me. Look the other way. Fuck, dude. He's trying, bro. Yeah. He's trying, man. Oh, she fucking broke the golden rule. Look at her. She messed it all up. Oh, man. Everybody else knows the rules. Look at all the guys. They know the rules. Don't look. Nope. Don't look. Don't look. But I mean, here's the thing, man. It's like, you know, she wants to kill that. But listen, he's not like just pulling this out of his ass. I mean, okay. Lebron. He's not pulling the accusation out of his ass. All right. Or Lebron's because Ain't no party like a diddy party. That's Lebron's words. Yeah, check it out. Hey, everybody know Ain't no party like a diddy party. So, yeah. Like, look, I'm gonna be fair. Because I'm not a big Lebron James fan. Not that I don't appreciate how great of a basketball player he is. Oh, he's a baller. Oh my god. Dude, he's one of the bet arguably one of the top three of all. He's great. Okay. Not arguing that. But I don't like how he pretends to be an intellectual. I don't like how he went through that phase during the Black Lives Matter, where he's reading Malcolm X, but he's always on the fucking first page. And he had the dark, he had the big, thick glasses on. And he pretended to be some sort of civil rights guy for like a year until it wasn't cool anymore. Now, you know what I'm saying? Right. And he always had racist shit to say and divisor shit to say. And I don't like that. I don't think that's I don't think that's a good thing for someone who carries that much weight in the country and has that many people looking up to him. I think a message of unity. I think a message of togetherness is a responsible message for someone like that. And then, you know, he is one of the first athletes to always pair it whenever the thing is immediately, which makes sense when you see him saying, hey, no party like a diddy party. So I'm going to be fair. I'm going to be fair. You could say that and not have been there. And just like had heard Diddy throw some good parties. And, you know, it's a Hollywood thing. And I'm just giving them the best of the doubt. It's it's possible. I don't know if he was there or not. Do you? This, I mean, listen, why would how could I possibly know a no party like a diddy party? If I ain't never been to what you hear about him like that. You don't listen. I'm just playing Devils advocate, bro. Like he may not have went, but that one when he said sure didn't fucking help him. Bro. Man, that's some weird shit. I never been there. Look, man, I don't, you know, I try not to pile on, but it ain't looking good. It ain't looking good. It ain't looking good, Brian. It ain't, it ain't, man. And you know, I mean, another shit like I mean, if he hadn't, if he didn't come out all the time and have something to say about everything, it wouldn't look like this was as true as it appears to look. Well, he's also big. Yep. He's been very quiet. No, he left social. He's been very quiet. No, no, no, he left social media. He's been very quiet. Oh, man. I mean, look, dude, I'm not going to sit here and make accusations of that level without people being actually guilty because that's a pretty serious shit. But man, it don't look good. You know, and what doesn't look good to me about it is how he always is like the first celebrity to chime in on the movement, right? When it was black square. And then it was vaccine. Yeah, he's always the guy. He's one of the main mouthpieces of the social movements, right? And it's always siding with quote unquote them, whatever it is. Yeah, right. Yeah. So I don't know, bro, you know, and like there's good things about LeBron. Like LeBron's done a lot for his communities and he's he's given back a lot to his cities. I really hope this shit ain't true about him, even if I don't really care for him. But I mean, it's certainly the dots are there. Yeah. I mean, we'll see. I mean, another development with this duty stuff. New development comes out. Escorts lining up to testify on behalf of Diddy and sex trafficking child. You see this? No. Yeah. A group of paid escorts is reportedly lining up to testify on shine. Diddy comes as behalf in his federal trial and sex trafficking charge. Just set to begin next May. So we all know Diddy's currently in jail. He's been in jail some September. He's been denied bail. He's just put in a third request. And if that's granted, he would have to stay in the New York City limits before his trial begins. So I don't think he's going out. I don't think so either. I don't think he's ever getting out. And I don't think he's going to make it to trial either. I don't think they're going to allow this dude to talk. I could be completely wrong. But like, dude, there's just no fucking way. He's got too much to say. Wait too much. Yeah. And everybody know. Well, now that these people are out of power, dude. And you know, it seems like, you know, some of these three letter agencies are feeling the heat of, you know, let's say realignment or deconstruction or however you want to say it. You know, this might be putting this might be put in the back burner. But I don't think so because a lot of people, you know, seem very nervous about this. Yeah. Well, I mean, my question is like these paid escorts like, what the fuck are y'all going to say? Like he didn't pay me. He didn't use a whole bottle. Like it was just half a bottle of baby oil. You know what I'm saying? What are y'all going to say? Like how do you defend? You don't seem like, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I read that the baby oil had GHB in it. I mean, he rubbed in and people skinned. Yeah. That's how people got all fucked up. I don't know if that's true or even possible. But, um, yeah, man, I don't know, dude. Look, I 100% believe that Epstein is a CIA massage app that was was used to leverage high power people to get them under the thumb of blackmail so that they could control the social narrative and society from many different aspects. I've gotten confirmation as of you in person from people who would know that that is accurate. This is identical to that. Only it's music and entertainment and different demographics. It's it's black people, right? It's black athletes, it's black entertainers. It's like the black Epstein thing, right? And, um, it looks the same. And when we look at how all these celebrities and all these powerful people are always saying the same message, it's not that they have the same views. It's that they use the same terms. They use the same catchphrases by now everybody's seeing those little clips where they got all those people, you know, on the news and then in public and celebrities and politicians and they're perting the same exact phrases. Where's where is that coming from and who's sending them the information to say, right? And why would they say it if they didn't believe it? Because there's no way that a lot of these people believe this shit. There's just no way you can't have this many people believe that much shit that is contradictory to how they even got to the place that they are at life, right? You just can't do it. So it's it's clearly what I think's happened with Diddy as I think Diddy was at some point early in his career, uh, caught doing some fucked up shit and then was put back into play as a guy who his job was to compromise other celebrities. And that's what it seems to be happening here. Yeah, man. I mean, it makes sense. I mean, I think even to the same point, I think a reasonable person could look at this and like, okay, well, yeah, but Andy, what if they were also just paid to say that shit? Okay, okay, cool, right? But like, again, somebody that has morals and values, I think we can give that, you know, the benefit of the doubts of most of these people. Well, I don't, you know, I'm already LeBron. I don't need your Vogue, I'm on it. Okay. Oh, yeah. Bro, you listen, but what happens if you don't say that's correct. That's where and there's definitely evidence of people who dissent from these places. Well, I think it's what happens to them. I think it's the carrot and the stick. I think it's like, okay, you do this. We're not going to have any problems. You'll be the biggest celebrity you've ever had. Bro, you'll have the biggest houses, the coolest life, the best yet. You'll be everybody will know you and we'll take care of you. But I'm going to need you to do this. And the first time they say, fuck, I'm not doing that. Then they throw you the video or the picture or the, and they say, look, do you want this to fucking go out? You better fucking say that, right? And then those people learn real quick who's in charge, right? Exactly. And this is why this is why, you know, you see so many celebrities who have gotten outcasted from the music industry or the movie industry. You know, people who weren't going along with the narrative. So that's what I think it is. That's what I think a lot of people think it is. That's what I've been told it is, especially with Epstein. And this seems like it's just the urban hip-hop music athlete culture Epstein. Yeah. I think she knows it is too. Yeah, she's that's not a happy face. Wait, last she broke the rules. Wait, hold on. Do you see any reason? Last one. This one. Guys, those are what you guys think, man. Let us know down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. We got thumbs up, we're dumb as fuck. That's why bring a headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, I got to treat for you in some clips. You got to treat. That's a tweet. Oh, I got treats to. I don't. You're eight of them all. Not sure. You got to share. Yeah, I'll share. What you got? Nothing. Yeah, I got to go steal it first. All right. Who in here has the best treats, by the way? Yeah, Medat does. He's always got the shit. He's got it all, bro. I mean, you know, let's got the good food. This is this is actually great. So this is a tweet from unnecessary roughness. It's just like a sports page on Twitter. That was a movie. That's a famous football movie, unnecessary roughness. Never seen it. Yeah. And you know, who was in it? No. Andrew Bernisky, the latter mayor from the program. I know Texas chainsaw masker. Okay. It was in that movie too. Gotcha. Yeah. I had no idea. Yep. Um, yeah. So you got, you got, uh, you got Cal State, right? Football program, great football program. Um, apparently they had a game and a fan tried to take a Cal players helmet. Uh, and the equipment guy wasn't gonna let it happen. He said no. Let's check. He said no, sir. Let's check this clip out. Oh, Helmet goes. Oh, more your ass, boy. Here comes the I love it. I do too. Bro, it was great. I wish you would have started swinging. Well, it gets bad. Bro, these little fucks got to learn to learn to listen, man. Yeah, they do, man. You know what I'm saying? There's too many little wild men out there, little boys that think they can do shit like that and no suffer no repercussions consequences. You know, like fucking with people and doing these pranks and just doing whatever they want. Do the, listen, with the culture shifting back to where we're getting, there's gonna be a lot more punches in the fucking face for these young dudes who are doing fucked up shit. Oh, yeah. No one's gonna feel sorry for you anymore. And we, and this idea of playing victim, you're not gonna do it anymore. And we're gonna celebrate the fucking you're gonna get a lot of open hand bitch slap treatment. So that you understand where you stand in the hierarchy of humanity. Yes. Yes. That kid deserved a bitch slap. Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. He got a fucking slam. I'll take it. Yeah, I think it was a good start. Yeah, but bro, there's nothing more embarrassing than getting slapped. Oh, it's the worst. Yeah, these kids like this deserve slap. Yeah. Oh, not the me slap. Now, what I thought was even the best part about this. All right. And shout out to Cal State. Shout out to that dude who went after him. Yeah. Well, they decided to, you know, in football for those of you guys who never played, you do something called film study. Right. They get in the game ball. We review the film. Yeah, watch it. And they reviewed the film. The entire team. Let's check this clip up. Yeah. They were the whole team's review in this clip. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, that's so awesome. You're not fucking great. It's so awesome. That is so awesome. That's fucking great. That's the best day that he's life. That's what's up, man. Give that kid a game ball. Bro, it's fucking great. Oh, man, that's so good. Now, let's step further. The head coach, then if I can break down of it now, I mean, it's important. Now, listen, the good coaches, the good coaches, when you do good shit, they're going to critique what you messed up 100%. And that's what you could have done better. That's what the coach did. Yeah. The one critique I would have is when we teach tackling on a chase tackle is we really want to come and secure the tackle and then come over the top, violently to separate the runner from the ball, or in this case, the helmet. Other than that, flawless technique by Trevor is his name Trevor. And I really appreciate the effort. He was enforcing one of the beliefs we have as a program, which is don't steal things. And I think we'd all be a lot better off with more trevers out there. So I appreciate his effort. And again, just next time we'd like to see the big right hand chopping down like we would on a chase tackle. But other than that, it was flawless. He is going on the teach date for sure. But again, it's a good lesson for all is, you know, don't steal stuff. Trevor's the fucking man. Trevor's the man. He got a cart now too. Trevor I don't travel to both. Skogger bow. That's a good name. Yeah. Skogger bow. You don't steal your hoe. Trevor Skogger bow. Yeah. Bro, I'm just going to say that was bad ass. That was fucking sick. Trevor, you're the fucking man. Yeah. You should walk into Thanksgiving with your fucking head held high. You do. You chin up. Anybody gives you any lip. You just fucking give him a look. You let him know what time it is. It's fucking ass whooping time. Fucking Trevor, man. I thought this was very MVP. Shit. It is bro. You got invited to the Reese's Senior Bowl. Trevor, Trevor, you come on the show. You invite here too. I know you're busy with your celebrity schedule and everything. I'm you're welcome to come on the show. We'll work it out. Yeah, figure it out. Yeah, we'll get you in. Trevor, you're the fucking man. Hey bro, let's fuck everybody should know it. Give that man a beer if he's over 21. Don't see all stuff. Where's the fucking man? I love it man.
