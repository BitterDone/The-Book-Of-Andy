What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the other fucking reality guys today, we have Andy and DJ cruise the motherfucking and that's what we're going to do. This is where we put topics on the screen. We speculate and what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people need to solve these problems going on in the world now. Other times we have shows within the show. We're going to have real talk, real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you guys some real talk. And then we have Q&A F on Mondays. That's our personal development show. Sometimes we do that in the middle of the week too. People call in, they get their questions answered. You can submit those questions to be answered a few different ways, the first way. Guys, email them. Email those questions in to askandidandifacelod.com. Or you could do what? Or you can put your question down in the comments section on the Q&A F videos. Or you can click the link in the description. Yeah, and you could actually be on the show. Other times we have 75 hard versus got a good one coming up here this week. Really good one. If you're unfamiliar with the 75 hard program, it is available at Episode 208. It is the world's most popular mental transformation program. It is the initial phase of the live hard program. You get that for free at Episode 208. 75 hard versus where people come on the show have completed that program. They talk about how their life was before, how their life is now, and how they don't suck anymore because they took control of all the shit that they can. There is a book on this called the book on mental toughness. It is a book that's available on my website, AndyPersona.com. It is not free. It does have a lot more information than the podcast at Episode 208. And most people like it because we're almost always sold out. So if you're the kind of person that wants to end up nuts, bolts, details, especially the nuts, you get that at AndyPersona.com. What's the website? AndyPersona.com. Go buy the fucking book. And by the way, tell someone about the show. We put a lot of time and effort into the show. And we'd appreciate if you guys would help us grow it. So don't be a hoe. Share the show. What's up? What's good gangster? I'm going to do half of this. OK. All right. I'm going to do the whole thing. I know. How many of those are drinking day? Just one, but I typically do two cups of coffee and then the energy drink. Coffee makes me a hoop. Yeah. I think it does everybody. I don't know anybody that what is that? Yeah, that's what it's for. Oh, really? Yeah. Clear as you write out. You've never been a coffee guy, though. I like to smell. OK. I like to smell coffee. Taste the coffee is OK. But I don't like the way it makes me feel because like, dude, I get super fucking stimulated. And then I have a super hard crash. And it goes like this, like a big peak. And then I want to go to sleep. Yeah. I guess that's where everybody else just keeps drinking it. She just don't stop. Yeah, she's not for me, man. I do like the way it smells. I do like coffee, man. I like coffee a lot. I've always been a coffee guy. My first cup, black, of course. And then second cup, black calories in there. Yeah, I'm saying some tax returns. Yep. That's right. There's actually a cool, like, it's funny because I was thinking about like baristas and stuff. And like, some people get way too fucking in their coffee game, right? But there is a shop on the south side called Sump's Coffee. And the dude used to be like a fucking chemistry professor at like UC Berkeley. Really? And then left and dedicated his whole life to fucking coffee. And he like fucking pours the stuff and like beakers and flask. Really good. It's fucking sick. Yeah, man. It's pretty cool. You know, it's just, you can only be into so many things. I don't have time for this. Fishing out of this. Yeah. I mean, I get it. You know, everybody's got their thing. Yeah, everybody's got to say my thing. Yeah. I remember that anyway. So what's going on in the world today? There's a lot, man. We got the chat rolling chat. How's the, how's the chat doing? Chat's okay. Yep. That's just on your guys's end. So it's fine. We are Penn State, whatever that means. Um. Yeah. All right. Let's go along with the show. Guys, remember though, if you want to get in that chat, man, click the link in the description below. You guys can sign up for that opportunity. Kind of randomize it. Who gets it? You know, we change it up every now and then. Yeah. Let's get into our cruise. So you've been lifting your entire life. Most of my life, most of your life, you've lifted. And you're a pretty strong fellow. Yeah. Like an ox. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? For sure. Like, probably the strongest human ever. Like, whatever. I don't know if we can say it now, but it used to be called like retarget strength. Is that still a thing? Uh, I guess. So you've never heard that term. No. Is that something that you black people say? No, that's a thing, man. You guys sound very discriminatory. No, that's a thing. Okay. The chat just, I heard it was called mongoloid strength. The mongoloid strength. That's how we know it. Oh, the mandingo strength. Yeah. That's different. Yeah. Different thing. Um, but yeah, you've been, uh, you've been lifting, you know, uh, for a decent amount of your life, right? Yeah. You know, you know, good technique, good form. I don't know about that. Oh, yeah. I know a couple of things about lifting. No, a thing or two. Yeah. Because I see a thing. Exactly. Okay. All right. Well, I need you to see this. Uh, it's fucking, uh, Zorhan, Zorhan mom, Donnie. Um, he, uh, he's mocked for struggling to, uh, bench press during Brooklyn's Wednesday event. So I would say out of all the places to like, you probably don't want to look bad. It's probably at a Wednesday event on the bench press. All right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty bad. Uh, but he's the front right now. Um, you know, we've talked about him. He's a socialist. He's young. He's 33. He's a socialist. He attempted a 135 pound bench press on Saturday. But was unable to complete a single repetition without assistance. Um, we got the clip. Um, they've been calling him mom scrawny on social media. Even Eric Adams posted the video. Um, from the venue, uh, showing him completing several repetitions with minimum, uh, support, and he's almost double his age. Um, lifetime before work versus a silver spoon. Um, is what he put on Twitter. Here's a clip. Let's check it out. Let's see what we think. I'm up in the fall. Yeah. This is how you move up in the polls. Yeah. It started off good. Now he's never been on the bench presses all night. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. Let me get one ball. Let me get three. Let me get three. Let me get three. Yeah. I could not redeem that word. I could not. Yeah. I mean, if you're over the age of like 15, you should be trying to bench 135. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's like the first goal of weightlifting when you start lifting, when you're like fucking a young man. You know what I mean? And I know young girls that could bench that. Oh, yeah. You know what I'm saying? Easy. So what is the rule for men? What is the rule? Like, because I've heard like, you should do your own weight, your body weight. There's no rule. I mean, it's just, you know, there's a lot of shit talking involved like any sport. You know what I'm saying? Like, we got this thing or like, if you have abs under 200 pounds, it's done fun count. No count. Yeah. Don't fun count. Okay. You know, that's pretty much it. That's it. Okay. That's the rule. Put a shirt back on, bitch. That's right. That's right. That's right. No, man. I think it's, you know, um, a for effort. Look, dude, here's the thing. It is reflective of socialist mentality to not train with weights or lift weights or do anything because they do not understand the idea. Uh, nor do they agree with the idea of investing time, effort and energy to produce a result. That's not what they think. They think that resources should be shared and pooled with no thought of who actually is responsible for the production. And a lot of people who believe in this political ideology, you know, they've, they've never done anything. They've never built a business. They've never worked out and gotten in shape. They've never lost a lot of weight. They've never gained muscle. They've never done anything that required them to invest to return. And that's why they're so comfortable feeling entitled to everybody else's fruits of the labor. Right? So, I mean, this does not surprise me that he can't do that. And, you know, I think it's very, very reflective of where culture has gone the last number of years because had this happened in 2020. People would have not really said anything. He probably wouldn't have even done it. But now we have Gen Z, you know, and the millennials and Gen X and everybody sort of moving back to understanding the role of men in society to be providers, protectors, certain level of fitness, higher standards. And I've seen a lot of outlets making fun of this dude that wouldn't have made fun of them four or five years ago. So, I think that's reflective of culture moving the way that we needed to move. You know, and it is embarrassing. And it's also, it's also a very good lesson in his lack of awareness. Like, you know, if I show up in an event and, you know, we're having a slammed up contest, I'm probably not going to fucking enter. You know, say it like it's not going to be happening. So, you know, you got to play to your strengths. And he's not aware of that. You know, and, and, and, you know, we kind of got a good glimpse of what kind of dude this really is because if you're that week. You know, if you're that week, wouldn't it make sense that you feel entitled to everybody else's shit? You know what I'm saying? Like, if you're unable to provide, protect at a primal level, wouldn't it make sense that you want a little bit of everybody else's? And I also think that there's a good lesson here for everybody else. Like, you're going to let people like this fuck with you and fuck up your life and mess with your city and your state and your town. These weak little bitch mother fuckers. No, fuck that. Okay, this dude came out two days ago and said he wanted to eliminate Mr. Meanor crime in New York City and then raise taxes on everybody else. Yeah, dude, this guy like. Is he really leading the polls for his party? Yeah, which is what he's up there. He's up there. I'm pretty sure he's I think I want to say he's under the Democrat Socialist. Can you check that? Listen, here, this is representative what we said for years and years and years. Okay, it's the weakest people in the world who cannot provide for themselves, who cannot defend themselves who are not capable when it comes to like physical work. And they aren't capable of mounting any sort of resistance. And the only way that they've ever manufactured power for themselves is through weaponization of the legal system. Or you know straight up just intimidation or the rest of the population, meaning capable men just allowing them to do it. And that's why good, strong, healthy, productive, high standard people have to give a fuck about what's going on in the world. Because if you don't and you just dedicate yourself to whatever you're going to gain and the fruits you're trying to produce, you end up in a situation where people who are not qualified to lead in any way, shape or form, vote themselves, your shit out of your pocket into theirs. And that's what we're dealing with here. So like real talk, what I see when I look at this is, you know, weakness, not understanding or how reality works, which is probably given in the perspective of why socialism is such as the world. And so socialism is such a smart strategy, which it's, it's inherently terrible. And there's been plenty of documentation about why it doesn't work. And ultimately dude, like, you know, I think it's a very strong signal of the resistance that we're up against, which is totally perceived. People go out and protest literally, they're fucking fat. They're, they're, they can't run five feet. They get out of breath. You know, like, what are we doing, allowing these people to, you know, they come to our protest with a trash can cut in half and a fucking pool noodle, like they're larking in the part to brave heart. Like, what are we, what are we doing, allowing these people any sort of traction in our society position? They can't do anything about it. They can't stop you. All they can do is call you names. And you all you got to do is say, yeah, now get the fuck over there. Right. Right. Right. Yeah, I think it's a, I mean, dude, there's something about his face. I just like look at his face like let the look at look at like there's just something about like, bro, he's totally listen. This guy's never been in a physical altercation. You the only way you can say and behave and act like this guy does is if you've never, ever experienced violence of any sort ever, right. Ever, yeah, like to stand in front of fucking grown men and say I'm going to tax you more and I'm going to let the criminals have this and these dudes are like this dude, the, the danger is like to me, I hear what these guys saying. I'm like, there, how the fuck are they saying this? Like, that's insane. But then I think about it. I'm like, well, their perspective is nothing's going to happen to them ever. So they just because nothing has. And then you have the all the other people who are common sense who are like what the fuck is going on. And they don't do anything. So these people think they can just run their mouths and move up. And by the way, it works. So, you know, the truth of the matter is. It is what it is and we can decide what we want to do about it. Yeah, what event should he have tried to compete in fucking dick sucking. I'm going to say the race of the bread line man. How are you going with your fucking bare hands slap. Well, I'm not guessing when your hands are french fries my hands hamburgers with my hands fucking but I don't eat like soup with my hands. Like, you don't eat chili with your hands. Like, you know, like, so like, I'm not it's not like I'm sitting here saying, you know, I'll do some nachos. That's about as messy as it'll get. But I mean, this motherfucker's on TV national TV scooping slop into his mouth like. No, man. You're sorry. Oh my god. A video is disgusting. Listen, here's what's going to happen. These people, the same thing happens to him over and over again in history. Eventually they get rounded up and they get killed because they take so much from everybody else. And they have no experience about where the line is that they cross it without fear and eventually society revolts and these people get killed and that's what happens over the course of history. That's why you don't ever see these people win because eventually the strong men and women of society say enough and then they handle these people. And like, I don't think he's, I don't think this guy's smart enough to understand the dangerous situation he's even putting himself in. You know, like all these people in New York who are getting mugged and having to deal with crime and having to deal with all this shit. And this dude's just out here saying, yeah, by the way, more. You know, like, you know, I don't know, like, if I had kids and let's say one of them got killed by one of their fucking stupid ass policies. I know what I would do. I've been to press more than 135. Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation, man. Let us know. Let's check the chat. I saw somebody put a comment in the saying like New York is is a shell of itself. Like it's not okay. It's just the chat says, I don't know, putting your hand in the shitter to unclog it. It counts as chip. That's different. That is a fucking emergency man. That's an emergency. Okay. Calm down. That's not the same thing. Zach does it count as two. Yeah. Oh, shit, man. Anyway, yeah, fuck me. Somebody kick Zach out of the chat. Let's do this. Yeah, fuck man. Guys, let us know down in the comments, what you guys think. What's the, what's the sloppiest food you'll eat with your hands? I want there's certain foods I won't eat because I got to eat with my hands like ribs. You wait. I won't eat ribs because the shickets all over my hands of face. I fucking hate it. I'll bail. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know people in this office here who love ribs and you go to eat barbecue with them and they'll somehow end up with fucking barbecue sauce and their fucking hairline. I will bathe in it. Bro, I can't stand it. It's gross. What is it with people that can't eat like they can't fucking eat without getting shit all over them? What is that? I don't know, but I'm gonna say it. You can tell if they like the food if they're wearing it. Really? Cause I just think they're an idiot. Yeah. Like if you really liked it, you wouldn't be wearing any of it. It'd be inside of you. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Zeesha knows. Yeah, man. All right. I'm with it. What do you think about this dude? Yeah, I don't like those are fair points. I'm making that's just something about like I feel like humans like we're it's in our primal instincts, right? Like we can immediately see somebody and sense good or bad. Yes, you and I can. What most of them know they can't conscience of know they can't the average person. Things like bro, look at what the average person finds it entertaining. You know what I'm saying? Like look at what they do. Look at what they care about. That's the thing. We give people too much credit dude. They're drowning in debt. They can't pay their bills. All they give a fuck about is getting the Thursday or Friday so they don't have to deal with that for two or three days. They don't understand any of this and they don't give a fuck because the government intentionally has created a situation where it's so hard for them to actually function that they can't afford to pay attention to this. You see what I'm saying? And then it gets worse and worse and worse and then they hear the rhetoric. Oh, we're looking out for the working man and that's all they hear the working man. That's all they hear bro. So they think well that's me. I'm voting for that guy but they don't think any of the repercussions of their actual policies nor do I think most people have the ability to see two or three steps down the road of what actually happens much less understand historically what has happened. So you know we're up against something here and now we're seeing it even worse right like because like people are starting to say you know like there's a lot of people who are turning on Trump I guess you would say something like that. And we live in this like all or nothing society now where like if someone doesn't do every single thing the way you wanted to do it you're like fuck up person they're a piece of shit without taking into consideration everything else. And so now we have this divide and these these divisions whether they be around you know politics or race or religion or socio economic these divisions are artificially amplified for the purpose of pulling votes away from the people who would actually fix what's going on because these people don't benefit from fixing what's going on at all they benefit from you being in poverty. They benefit from our people actually not being able to pay attention to how they're getting stolen from and this guy's just another one of those guys dude you know yeah I don't like his face. I don't like it guys that's what you think down in the comments let us know with that being said man let's get into the rest of our what what qualifies him to lead. He was a rapper he's been up all that I go to come on man this guy's not a fucking leader he's manufactured whatever yeah guys let's get on with the crews remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sell a calm you guys can find the link there or check us out anywhere where you listen or watch podcasts you can check us out there from your favorite podcasters. You too Bruce that's us right I know that was us yeah I know let's get into it. Just reporting that out there you are let's get into it man we got hell out number one let's dive into it got it before we get into it. Okay I got a beef oh no not really okay guys make sure that when you drink a four-manorgy drink you tag four-manorgy and tag me in it. I just want to see him that's all and then on top of it when you see someone running their mouth bring in the horses on them and crush their soul just remember that that's what we like to do around here crush people do it right now. You're a crush somebody no I'm gonna tag you all right right now not you. Oh yeah oh you won't share my I just shared you today that's enough DJ. Yeah all right all right let's get a tough first headline guys. I got to go up to Chicago. Got to go to Chicago. Headline I'm on reach Mayor Johnson the people of Chicago will rise up against Trump's theory. So there's a lot of stuff happening right now in the landscape of our American cities. Sunday on MSNBC's the weekend Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said that if President Trump sent the National Guard to his city the people would rise up against tyranny. Coho's Jonathan K. Parts said quote I just want to get your reactions to another thing in the Washington Post story I'm reading directly here says the use of thousands of active duty troops in Chicago also has been discussed but is considered less likely at this time. So I'm do that with active duty Marines in the streets of Los Angeles what would be the reaction in Chicago. If the president of United States does indeed put active duty military in the streets of Chicago Johnson said quote well again you know the city of Chicago does not need a military occupied state that's that is that's not who we are. I commend the work of Mayor Bass my colleague and you know all the folks in Los Angeles who stood up and fought you know against this you know authoritarianism here is the bottom line they don't have police power there's nothing they can do you know these are federal troops they did not go through the training that our police officers go through so they cannot even enact police authority. So that's going on because you know came out over the weekend that Trump was going to potentially be putting more National Guard and more military and a few states and made the idea the idea that he talked about was rotating them so one and by the way Washington DC's had zero murders this has happened first time ever ever ever ever that's crazy and. What he's talking about is moving this same situation to the crime written cities and by the way I was listening to the breakfast club this morning on the way into work and they were all about it they loved it you know why they loved it because they are tired of the fucking crime to. I'm seeing a lot of clips of people like even in DC talk about you know like this one do he posted a video he's walking down the street had a nice watch on had a nice chain he's like yeah I can do this now yeah you know I'm saying he's like I ain't worried about nobody I'm going to auto blocks yeah knowing that I'm going to do nothing that's right you know I'm saying like and I understand the argument that people have you know people have a hesitancy because of what's going on with Palantir in the surveillance state that they've created and you know the authoritarianism. Quote unquote is what they're concerned about and I think that's a right that's definitely something to be concerned about but I think it's more important to recognize that when we have an immediate problem such as a murder rate that represents you know some of the most dangerous cities in the world they have to stop that problem somehow and I personally think it's. As long as it is what they say it is a temporary thing where they rotate around and clean this up and work with the police and then the standard is in force afterwards I mean how can you argue that that's not a good thing 100% and it's not like and that's that I think that's the important piece who. Just putting troops in these cities is not that's not the fix that's not you can't just do that one thing and be done is you know doing other things like he's signing executive orders that are aimed at ending cashless bail in DC and across the nation. Because this was a big piece right like and we've we've heard this a lot from from police officers that are in the field in these communities is like do they'll lock somebody up. For you know a ridiculous crime violent crime armed robberies you name it and then 24 hours later they're right back out on the street. You know until it's like the cops their hands are tied behind the backs what are they supposed to be doing you know I'm saying and then the prosecutors who are elected by George Soros. They're not prosecuting those crimes right and so it's just this constant like cycle this vicious cycle where the communities the people were losing and nobody wants it bro nobody really wants it the only people that are against this shit are people that are being paid to antagonize and cause disruption at these protests in these cities now I understand like I said where people will say you know this is a authoritarian. Not yet. Could it be if that was a permanent thing for sure but here's the thing and this is not this I don't agree with this by the way but. It's reality. We've been under a surveillance state for 20 something years say new people are saying oh well you know they're going to turn it what are you talking about bro you walk around with a digital device that records everything you say everything you type every email you send every text you send. And it tracks you everywhere you go whether you turn it off or wrong you think that like turning off the tracking makes you not trackable to fuck out of here man like we've already been in that and is it not cool yeah I think that should be completely stopped. But at the same time it's here and it's being used and it's been being used and so. I think a lot of that shit's over blown we got to address right now what the problem is now and what the problem is now is that we can't go in our own cities and enjoy a dinner or walk down the street or where jewelry that we worked our life to earn and you can think whatever you want not like it and think whatever but like dude it doesn't matter if you go to some of the more civilized countries in the world. You can leave the key to a rose Royce on the fucking glass for a week in no real touch it alright and people say oh the most civilized countries yes when they cut people's hands off yes for stealing shit that's why you can leave your rolls yeah so there has to be some level of accountability and fear that when the rules are broken there are consequences and right now here in this country that does not exist. But it doesn't exist you know I'm saying like people are afraid and by the way the only motherfuckers that are afraid of the law here are the people who aren't breaking it right right yeah no it does not exist at the scale that it needs to be for sure but I'm fine with this because you know like I remember this clip I think it was a Karin jump here whatever her name is she she she was doing the press briefing or whatever talking about that move the cashless bail and like. Dude she read off the the crimes that were included in that bro and like murder like wait a minute like what do you what do you mean you know I'm saying and so that's going away I'm cool with that there was another important thing that came out this is an AP news article I want you guys to look at. I'm going to go ahead line reads Trump moves to ban flag burning despite Supreme Court ruling that Constitution allows it okay now I got something on this all right so this was an executive order that Trump just signed this I have a clip here let's check this clip out real quick. An executive order on flag burning charges your attorney general would you listen to this is a very flag burning all over the country the burning flags all over the world they burn the American flag and as you know through a very sad court I guess it was a five to four decision they called it freedom of speech but there's another reason which is perhaps much more important it's called death because what happens when you burn a flag is the area goes crazy if you have hundreds of people they go crazy you could do other things you can burn this piece of paper you can and it's but when you burn the American flag it incites riots at levels that we've never seen before people go crazy in a way both ways there's something going crazy for doing it there are others that are angry angry about them doing it yeah so I believe the specifics was like you get like a year minimum in jails or something like that great yeah with it but the article the headline here you know trying to make it like oh he's over turning the Supreme Court and I know it was a good decision I got some cases here because I think it's important for people to understand that there were plenty of things that's the Supreme Court thought was okay that we've done in the past that like hey it's probably not okay example number one dread Scott right when they said that hey slavery is okay and cool yeah where that happened or what about plusy v Ferguson segregation separate but equal that was completely fine you see the sign that we held up the other day oh yeah you know or what about minor v hyper set right for all the the women out there this was the Supreme Court ruling that said yeah women were citizens but had no constitutional right to vote or bowers v hardwick right that states could criminalize private consensual homosexual activity so the Supreme Court has ruled on plenty of things in the past plenty of things doesn't make them right doesn't make them right and burn in the American flag is not fucking right it's a domestic terrorism back what I think it should be here's what I think it should be I think it should be if you burn a flag whatever happens to you next is not prosecutable that's what I think that would correct the problem without them having to go to jail so as long as you like you understand yeah because here's the problem there's lots of people like me and you who see that shit and and and dude I would do something if I saw it right or absolutely and there's lots of people that want to do something but they know what's going to happen they're going to be pulled into this leftist legal system that's weaponized against people like them and there'll be an example of so you know I don't know I I would rather be that way than then go to jail but I mean jail is fine too yeah just fine to just saying I'm a creative I'm a creative I say deport them yeah if you don't like it here get the fuck out out bro I think that's a real thing like I think if you do things like that then go just go yeah just go you don't have to burn anything just go if you hate it here so fucking bad just I won't broke cool with my taxpayer don't want because it's hypocritical they're just full of shit dude it's fucking bullshit man yeah and Trump's Trump like broke sometimes you say shit when they burn a flag they're gonna it's creates riots like we've never seen before no we've seen them burn the flag and we've seen the riots like they suck you know his hand like what are you talking about we all saw what I was right but uh you know I I've never been a believer in that burning the flag is free speech personally protesting like like when Colin Kaepernick did he did this thing you know didn't agree with it I totally didn't agree with it like in fact I fucking liked him we used to talk on Instagram I liked them until that but I don't think you should have went to jail I will defend his right to correct correct but when you start burning the flag whenever like people here have had family members die or deal with you know dismemberment or disfigurement or you know ended up committing suicide because of some of it dude no you don't belong in our society at all and I think that the person who does that who after they spend their year in jail they're automatically disqualified from any sort of government assistance or aid for life okay or they they get deported brother these people how can you burn the flag of a country and then turn around and ask the citizens of that same country to fund your lifestyle right you know what I'm saying there's a lot of hypocrisy going on here but it's low IQ hypocrisy they don't get it for sure because they have the same breath of like oh Trump's a dictator for doing that okay well you go to China and burn the Chinese flag in China yeah see what happens yeah or almost anywhere dude go do that and go do go do it in Russia yeah do it in North Korea well dude in Russia here's what'll happen the Russian men who aren't bitch you fuck you up gonna fuck you up dude and that's not how it metals the fucking doesn't happen here anymore it doesn't happen here anymore because they have weaponized the justice system to where the people of common sense understand that if they do these certain things they will be made an example of it's totally backwards it's the complete backwards of how it should be what should be is that people who commit crimes are made an example of not the people who try to keep ordering society you know so I'm all with it bro like bro snap out I think I thought I thought we were being invaded bro huh I thought we were being invaded I had to say I had to take care of me burn the flag I thought I was a fucking invasion or something bro it would take about three times for a person like that to get the fucking shit kicked out of them for it to stop yeah you know I'm saying if they knew that that was the out yeah yeah 100% man chat what we got on this let's jump into see what we got we got to have large amounts of people to start holding people accountable in order to set the example really we don't need large amounts of people we need a few people and like when they did this thing with like Daniel Penny yeah that was the point of that I was trying to make better not stand up to crime or we're gonna do this to you and you know yes he's been exonerated and freed but he spent a year or more of his life and fucking jail that's not acceptable you know what I mean yeah that definitely so you make an example and these kids get their their ass beat a couple times like that rampage kid did that guy in the ring bro fucking they'll stop doing that shit you know we got something on that later yeah we got something on that later but yeah man guys jump down in the

could beat me in that that's right no chance man no chance well now that we have some motivation let's keep a cruise cruiser yeah I am motivated same yeah I feel it I'm ready to flip this table came from the fucking soul mm-hmm balls what came from the balls it came from the loins yeah it came from the stinger wait what all right let's do a show hello on two yeah let's get headlight number two it's all downhill from here yeah all right man we gotta go international man let's go into national I saw the story this is crazy but let's talk about I got a nice little thing here for this we gotta go to Germany heroic American tourists brutally stabbed while protecting two women in Germany as a model from upstate New York do this story it's crazy it's crazy okay so let's dive into this a little bit because we got we're gonna take a little international you haven't seen this no we want to take a little international road trip here so the heroic American tourist who was stabbed while we're gonna we're gonna road trip to Germany I don't like the boats oh it's fair it's fair what if we put you in a car and then put the car on the boat that's fine yeah I think that counts okay as long as it's not in the basement but that's a road trip yeah still technically road trip yep the heroic American tourist who was stabbed while protecting two women being violently assaulted on a tram in Germany has been identified as a part-time model from upstate New York who was left with gruesome facial injuries John Rudat who is 21 was hospitalized with gruesome knife wounds to his face after stepping in when he saw two women being attacked in the eastern German city of Dresden early Sunday according to an online fundraiser now we don't have the full clip I do have this picture of the aftermath you got kind of cut right across his nose there and more information came out that these were two dudes two migrants that that did this right and again like it's I don't know if it's enough to point out you know there's certain um consistencies that are happening across the world right now you mean like people from third world countries attacking everybody who's not yeah their own country yeah yeah yeah um and it's happening a lot and the scary thing is like did you look at some of this stuff um you know like these numbers Elon Musk actually reposted this um but it's rape crime reports okay um and then in the year 2000 okay England and Wales for example had 85 hundred reports of rape fast forward to 2023 England and Wales had 68 000 oh yeah okay Germany 81 hundred in the year 2000 Germany in 2023 39 000 France in 2000 was 7500 now France is at 42 000 now there's one country that didn't or apparently is unaffected which is Poland whose numbers actually went down yeah you know what fuck around they don't have migrants yeah they didn't fuck it let them in yeah they did not let them in now the crazy thing with all of this right um because these these these sexual assaults are happening all over western countries of westernized countries I I guess you could say um but the you know and I always I think it's important that we pay attention to these countries because they are a few years ahead of us yeah that's gonna be happening here it's a very important thing yeah um and I saw this other clip that just came out the other day um and it's in the UK um and and just watch this interaction well let you in could you got England flag yes no let them be a link to England flag why because it's a simple rule by management simple rule by management and the first thing you don't video ask that please it's kind of request nah I'm asking you's why you're not letting people in with England flags in England I have them serve everyone's like you know what's the problem no I just want to put it online and show that this poor what is this poor man the man I'm planning and their management are refusing people with England we are not involving ourselves in any of these processes it's not a process where an England flag you know Trump you know he's got he's quite pretty good so I have to take me in the flag off to put it so I'm just putting in England so I know the language barriers but but essentially the guy saying the the the the bar will not let him in because he had a UK flag on him so this is a bar in the UK yeah and they're not allowing him in because he has a UK flag on yeah that is scary for me to see well it should be that's the point why do you think they're raping all these people it's not because they're just some horny dudes bro they're trying to repopulate the fucking country with people who look like them that's what they're trying to do that was the plan the entire time that was the fucking that's their plan okay and that Soros knows this all the people behind this know this everybody who's done anything at the world economic forum knows this that's the goal the goal is to create a one-word culture where people don't have national pride anymore they're all just one race of people that goes with the idea of globalism should be pretty obvious like how do you get all cultures to be the same well you breed out the culture of every single individual country through mass invasion of third worlders and that's what they're dealing with and like in this what's really fucked up dude is that this is all happening because people are afraid to be called racist or they're afraid to be called a name and like look at the numbers right like so is it worth it England for you to have almost ten times as many rapes as you did 25 years ago because people don't want to be called names and now it's progressed into this thing where if you even make a Facebook poster or this or that you might end up going to jail don't you wish you had spoken up years ago now did you learn your fucking lesson now it's going to be much harder for you to do what it is that needs to be done protect the country so this is why I said during covid I keep saying it over and over again here in this country in the United States of America it is not going to get any easier than it is today tomorrow it's going to be harder the next day it's going to be harder and if we the America people continue to cower at being called names then it's just going to make it easier for them to do what they're trying to do and you're going to reap the fucking punishment of that years down the road so yeah I mean it's not it's to me it's I could see it very clearly no well do what's crazy so as DJ was cruising the internet right and trying to put all of this stuff together I saw a very interesting headline from CNN okay CNN headline reads rare human case of flesh eating parasite new world screw worm identified in us okay now I saw this and like the fuck is this about like what is this you know it's not you know I'm like let's still a little dive let's see what they're talking about and they say that a rare case of travel related new world screw worm was identified in Maryland and a patient who traveled from El Salvador spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said the US Senator uh centers for disease control and prevention and the Maryland Department of Health are investigating the case of the flesh eating parasite which was confirmed on August 4th HHS spokesman uh Andrew Nixon said no additional information about the patient's condition was made available all right and then you've got a little bit more uh and they say that they've been actually tracking this this outbreak of new world screw worms the larva uh farm of a type of fly that's known to nest in the wounds of warm blooded animals and slowly eat them alive it's been spreading across central America since early 2023 infestation records uh have been recorded in Belize Costa Rica El Salvador Guadalmala Honduras Mexico Nicaragua Panama and then I had a thought where the fuck have all these migrants come in oh central America Guadalmala Honduras El Salvador it's where the majority have been points of entry I'm not saying Guadalmala and people well this is where they're coming from yeah here's my problem here's the problem because again I like Trump I voted for Trump three times okay I will absolutely give credit where it's due and and give give all the good stuff when he does things right but when he does things that I don't agree with we have to call it out and then this clip comes after asking all of this let's check this out presidency would like me to come to China it's a very important relationship as you know we're we're taking a lot of money in from China because of the tariffs and different things and uh it's a very important relationship we're gonna get along good with China I hear so many stories about we're not gonna allow their students or we're gonna allow their students to come in we're gonna allow it's very important 600,000 students it's very important but we're gonna get along with China but it's a different relationship that we have now with China it's a much better relationship economically than it was before he just greenlit 600,000 more people to come into this country yeah now I'm I don't know about you dude but I'm getting real tired I feel like we need a full stop on anybody coming to this country yeah for for legally or illegally for for a few years yeah for a few years I don't know well what do you guys think what do you got on this bro this is the guy's modeling picture yeah there's not that many pictures online it's gonna be a successful more successful model with that scar yeah you know what I'm saying so anyway um you're asking me what I think that sounds like maggots that look like maggots and that what maggots do is get in a wound and eat the shit yeah but apparently these are like really bad maggots okay was there good ones I don't know yeah so um yeah this is a problem and it to me it doesn't seem like it's happened I mean it's not to me it's statistically factual they are not getting these people out of the country at a rate that makes any real meaningful difference over the course of the next 10 years 20 years so uh yeah and also um Trump did you hear what he did about the rehiring of the IRS no yeah so he's starting to rehire some of these IRS agents that he promised to disband uh you know on his campaign trail so like we have all these things that are not happening that he ran on you know oh remember and he's like oh well maybe we'll abolish the IRS nope not happening they're rehiring some of the people the 88,000 people apparently um um you know the migrants are gonna have to be expelled at a much faster rate I mean there's a lot of shit that he's that he's not doing you know the Epstein lists and all these things and like dude it's very frustrating uh it's very hard to continue to support him but you can't support the other side right because they're even much worse right and so you know it's it's unfortunate this is where we're at you know I really believed that this was gonna be a house cleaning like we never fucking saw before and you know maybe we'll be maybe maybe there's I mean I'm sure there's things I don't know but um it needs it needs to speed up if it's gonna if we're gonna prevent what's happening in these other countries and if you want to know if it works or doesn't work you have the case study right there with Poland okay so this is again going to come in to the realm of responsibility of the citizens to speak up and be very vocal about not wanting these people here and I understand why people don't like saying that because that makes them feel like they're judging people on their fucking race and I would say that America compared to most countries culturally is far less racist openly than most countries and most Americans hear that and they're like what are you talking about well have you been to other countries they don't like people not from there there's very few countries that tolerate people that aren't from that country without being very openly critical and racist about it so not liking people that don't look like you sound like you uh etc is is a natural thing with humans everywhere in the world it's like that here is different because we grow up with other cultures we grow up seeing people as Americans not as these invaders from somewhere else and we have a beautiful thing here in America but when you introduce this shit it becomes much harder to feel like you're not being racist when you're criticizing people from where they are it's an easy argument right like you say well I don't want these people here they're not America's citizens will you fucking hate brown people no that's not what I said what I said was I don't want people here that aren't Americans and the same thing happens when you talk about Israel you talk about Ukraine like I don't give a fuck what's going on in Israel I care what's happening here oh my god you hate those guys well I will if you continue to try and take our money you're right and fucking put them ahead of us right so same thing with Ukraine all this shit so at the end of the day we got to quit letting people take our words and twist them into things that they aren't and we have to stand by what we think is right and wrong and people who are not American citizens are coming to our country and committing a disproportional amount of crime and uh that's not great and it shouldn't be okay by anybody and if someone has to call you a name then fuck them who cares right like are you willing to be called names for your daughters to be protected you see what I'm saying like who gives a fuck what they say and they've used this weapon on us for years and years and years and now we're seeing the actual repercussions of Americans saying oh don't call me that now this is what the repercussion about is so yeah that's what I think it's a process I mean look dude these people should be rounded to fuck up bro and set back where they're from bro the clothes all the borders now yeah well I mean Trump has nobody else here they haven't had anybody come across in months like zero so um yeah dude look this is at the end of the day to stop violent crime you have to you have to stop importing criminals and you have to enforce the fucking punishments on crime no and neither of those things have truly happened yet but they are happening so we'll see what happens you know if Trump goes through city by city by city and rounds all these people up and get some of the fuck out of here you're not going to hear a lot of arguments from the people on the other side they might they might quietly you know not say I'm voting for Trump but when they go outside and they you know it's nice and civilized and not chaotic and you don't have fucking people running all over the city doing all kinds of fucked up shit they're not gonna vote for that again after it's gone you know what I mean right now it's been conditioned in slow by slow by slow by slow to where people are like oh this is just the way it is no it's not the way it is you're not old enough to understand how cool it used to be you don't have the perspective yeah so well and just because this is how it is doesn't mean that's how it's should not be like this well that's a whole another discussion because people cannot figure out that we cannot go backwards this isn't about going backwards this is about creating from this point forward what the ideal situation is and we have a chance as Americans right now to truly stand up and force change by standing for the right things in a vocal way holding leaders like Trump and Vance and everybody else accountable to the things they said they were gonna do so you know you get Trump on TV and he's like oh you guys are a bunch of weak people for caring about this no motherfucker you cared about this you said you were gonna do these things and we are not idiots for fucking wanting them to be done when we voted for that to happen and that's the problem that we're dealing with now and that's why so many people are becoming disenfranchised with some of the things that he's doing and they're having a hard time standing by him and whoever is on his PR team I was talking to someone close to their team about a week ago and they were in they were trying to tell me nobody cares about COVID anymore nobody cares about the F-steen list no you don't care because you're in that ecosystem everybody else remembers what happened to them during COVID everybody else understands how they get raped by the fucking tax code in this country everybody else understands why they don't want to go out to eat or go to social venues or go downtown in their own city everybody cares about that and when we have people who are in that ecosystem who just keep like telling Trump yeah yeah yeah you could do whatever you do we end up in a situation like we're in where people are losing trust in them and it would be an easy thing for him to correct but you know how hard would it be to explain the F-steen situation a little bit more clearly how hard would it be to say look when I say it's a hoax this is what I mean but he's not doing that he continues to say it's a hoax it's a hoax it's a hoax how is it a hoax how is it automatically a hoax now and so if it really is some sort of FBI CIA rush a gate bullshit well all you got to do is explain a little bit more about why that is and it would solve all this you know dissension in the ranks that's happening because of his inability to explain himself properly and you know there's another possibility they could be openly working the case and maybe it's not time to pull the hammer but I mean I don't think anybody's gonna I don't think anybody's gonna be upset about rounding up the criminals including the F-steen people and talking about what it actually is versus isn't so you know you know we'll see yeah man check the chat man the one thing I know dude the one thing I know is this it takes a long time to make changes in organization a big organization there's not a bigger organization that's ever existed in human history than the United States government so to think that in eight months you could completely get it going that's not a realistic time frame no matter what you think or don't think because that would be hard at a company of my size not to mention uh the whole country so there people don't understand that either yeah you know because they don't have experience realizing that when you're when you are in a bad place culturally and you have problems that takes time to correct it's like turning around a fucking cruise ship versus turning around a jet ski you know what I mean it's a big difference yeah big difference let's check the chat man uh somebody said I almost lost our business because of these people we remember yeah that's right nobody fucking forgets man my grandfather died on zoom I remember yeah bro so you know like he's it like look at everybody's response they're pissed off about this shit right because they're minimizing it every time they're asking about it like nobody cares that fucking this man's grandfather died they don't think it's a big deal they're like oh that was just the way of the way no it's not the way those crimes against humanity and we expect people to be held accountable and we voted for people to be held accountable like they promised they would and we have yet to see that which is what's causing people to be fucking pissed off yeah bro you know rightfully so by the way oh yeah that's real man rightfully so yeah guys let us know what you guys think on this conversation down in the comments with that being said we got one more uh one more headline hello on three number three we've had number one number one number two you're heading up what's number three that diarrhea it's both at the same time oh okay yeah one plus two three that makes sense all right hello number three pro wrestler attacked by Roger Jackson in horrifying video doing fine and recovering send that negative prison I'm gonna say it I'm gonna say it he going to do uh Stuart Smith was diving to a K.A. Psycho stew is reportedly doing fine and recovering as of Saturday night after he was violently pummeled by the son of farmer UFC star Quentin rampage Jackson TMZ reported the update on Sunday along with the news that the LAPD is looking into the incident involving Roger Jackson at a pro wrestling event in Los Angeles um you guys have seen the clip I'm sure everybody has seen the clip I got the clip but we've seen the clip um Star calling DJ Django yeah yeah somebody told me so I called me Django yeah dude listen it's fucked up man it's fucked up and you know I'm usually of the belief like you know hey listen like let let everything come out and then make your emotional decision right um and I did I did I like because all the clips have been out right all the clips have been out but the big clip that was circulating around was um you know the the initial start where they were out in the back parking lot and psychos stew it you know I haven't seen the whole thing yeah I saw with him the pummeling yeah okay well so it started they were in the back parking lot or whatever and psychos stew goes up to to Roger and you know because I some like oh you know you know who I am and like slam the fucking beer can on his head I can not a bottle can prop it was a prop can okay um and then a little tension happened right um and then uh so initially that was the video that came out and then the the pummeling in the ring um which is this clip we'll watch this real quick you you know it okay I can I can't yeah I can't yeah 22 times yeah as I'm in 22 times okay and then he was you know like the other wrestlers got in there they they had to hold him back and here's the thing but then another video comes out that after that initial altercation the back parking lot psychos stew actually apologize to Roger here's the clip I appreciate it I know I'm I know you're gonna come out on your mat so I have them come out during your mat so we can seal the whole thing and we'll make some out of you know what I'm saying yeah so stew was saying it basically was like dude I'm sorry I thought you were like a part of the stuff you know I'm saying I saw the cameras like I thought this was all still scripted where wrestlers you know I'm sorry yeah apologize multiple times yeah all right now it seems like he was genuine yeah it's very genuine yeah right now apparently there was an like some type of agreement that like Roger was gonna enter the ring uh-huh or you hear him right there he says we'll set it up we'll make a thing out of it exactly exactly so he was influenced to go out there and they were all on the same page but then Roger does that shit well how do you know that's not what they fucking told him to do like bro I don't think it goes that crazy listen dude listen again how fucking smart is this kid he's probably not real fucking smart no okay and I mean obviously so he's around all these dudes that are doing this shit and this guy says oh yeah we'll go out the ring we'll seal it we'll make a thing out of it well what does that mean to him what does that mean to a young kid who no no no no listen dude you gotta think this through how do you know how many times does that guy been in a wrestling ring how many times he been in a wrestling school these dudes fucking hit each other all the time that's real shit you're you're looking at it from your experience on what you know and what you've been told and dude I don't disagree with you that that was fucking fucked up and I don't know what's going to happen but there is a lot of perspectives in this situation you know that led up to this and it wasn't just like the dude got like the problem I had with it I guess is like people are making it seem like he just got out of his chair and went fucking crazy and that's not what happened yeah first for sure and it was not there was there was plenty of things that went into this and he doesn't look like like look at this screenshot we got on screen right now does he look mad to me he looks like he's listening to me it looks like he's like around the dudes trying to figure out how the fuck it works and shit and if you got one of the main dudes right here this big guy telling him hey you know we'll get you to come out during the ring and we'll do this and we'll seal it up what does that mean that's all I'm saying I get it I get it I just like I have a hard time and he grew up around rampage Jackson and USC and like did he listen to niggas can go to prison hold on look bro does he have a pass to the shit a past and fighting or a beating people's asses and being violent in the ring yeah I mean listen he's fault like I mean the USC type and the next stuff and amateur yeah I mean look man I it seems like there's something there's some shit missing here yeah that's all like yeah well so I mean here's the thing so the guy stew was sent to that I would be interested to hear what he says now he hasn't said anything okay all right neither has stew to my to my knowledge that's what I'm saying this guy the victim yeah but rampage Jackson did come out shortly after in a statement when this happened and oh I think Roger know I did see something Roger came out and said my bad or something like that and but rampage Jackson is dead who listen rampages is phenomenal fighter phenomenal fighter I mean in my in my I mean I've been watching UFC since UFC one yeah not the most knowledgeable person but I always watch fucking rampage he's of for love one fight right and I honestly believe I mean we like him as an actor too well this one we talk about this too it's like you know the you know rampage has that entertainer fucking value that he brings he's not just a good fighter he's he's great on camera he's got the look he's got a character and I'm confident that like if I were to ever meet rampage off camera you love them he'd be fucking just as phenomenal yeah okay um but and so rampage came out with this statement um shortly after I'll read it it says uh I quote I want to clear up the misinformation about my son Roger I've been confirmed that the wrestler's student Smith aka psycho stew is awake and stable Roger was unexpectedly hit in the side of the head by him moments before Smith's match Roger was told that he could get his quote unquote payback in the ring I thought it was a part of the show it was bad judgment and a work that went wrong Roger is a MMA fighter not a pro wrestler and had no business involved in an event like this I don't condone my son's actions at all he suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact as a father I'm deeply concerned with his health and the well being of mr. Smith that being said I'm very upset that any of this happened but my main concern now is that mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery I apologize on his behalf and to kick for the situation because it was all live being live stream um yeah yeah he was like yeah rampage was streaming when this happened and it had to cut his he's streamer yeah that's what he's been in here lately because he's you know he's retired from the UFC and stuff but um do listen look bro I see both ways that's my saying I everybody's look we got to be fucking fair no things like just like you know and dude I get a lot of hate because of the Trump thing like oh you won't listen man do you know are you there I didn't get where I'm at in life by fucking making rash judgments about things I have to weigh all the the variables and then make a decision and we don't know them we don't know them with Trump you don't fucking know you're I know I know you don't know you don't know what's coming down the pipe you don't know what's going to happen and until you know it becomes very clear that we're out of time and he hasn't done any of this shit like then we you know never thought but but dude like I just I don't know man like this seems weird it's it was an unreasonable action like did see like okay take it out take take the whole everything we said away if some dude jumped in a ring and slammed to do be his ass like that yeah he's going to prison yeah for sure yeah and deservingly so but let's say he because WWE is a fucking it's it's it's a it's a it's a it's a theater performance but it's still very physical so did someone teach him how to soft throw punches or pull punches so that it looks real but not real like there's just a lot of things here man that I don't know and like I would I don't know I don't know I don't know what to think yet yeah I do it was horrible to watch dude dude dude but I mean you're asking you're you're you're saying that someone who hurts someone in a ring of now we're going to press charges like are we going to press charges and hockey fights well I think I think the problem that I'm having with this are we going to press charges when the NFL gets to here well but here's the thing the difference in those situations is bro like when somebody's unconscious you don't keep going like at what point listen to become excessive it was excessive I would say after the fucking fourth one look it was hard to watch you know like I can get it like I don't mind watching that stuff yeah it was still hard to like I get it dude you're a young dude you got pride you know your dad being your dad you can't be no bitch I get all of them I don't think that's what it was I think I think it was a little bit of that I do I do because like from that initial like little scuffle they had in the back bro like these young dudes like they they take stuff so personal you know and I think that's true I think it was I think I think he took it to way too personal and even after the apology like he already made up in his mind I'm gonna get you I got to get I have to get you yeah you know and like to me bro was pre-meditated per that's how I look at it I think that the you know you asked what's the difference between this and I were gonna do the same and hockey bro the difference is like bro that was completely uncalled for you you do the slam throw a couple of shots even dude was fucking a con bro I have 20 I didn't know the other guy stopped it they did they're not I know they stopped it but like they let it go pretty long well they thought they were playing you know I'm saying but they were standing right there and they thought they were playing the how the fucking you and I say 100 I get it okay I would say after after the five after fifth one because I got mean the guys they like I got I'm gonna give it back to the video real quick yeah I mean that's bad okay yeah I I don't know man I don't know he definitely seemed like he lost his mother fucking mind yeah he went black bro he saw it he saw it there is a video of him walking away from the fight where he says I'm tired of people thinking I'm a bitch and making fun of me and all the stuff oh well right after it yeah so there's more to it yeah okay yeah I mean look dude all what I'm saying is is that when it comes to events that simulate violence or have violence we can't start prosecuting people for being fucking violent for sure and if it was something that was like hey I'm tired of people fucking with me and this and that and that's why he did that then yeah that's a problem yeah now like what I'm really curious to see to be real and I want I'm interested to see what stew says you know what yeah me too I want to know with how you know saying what he handles it what he how he sees it yeah you know but like I'm beyond dude it just it did not look good to me no just don't look good man no look man I'm not saying I'm not saying he somehow like dude what he did was fucked out you're not saying he's innocent no for sure for sure but I'm trying to lead into like how that happened and what happened yeah you know and it's like if that were like outside the ring and that were like on the street it's very clear what the fuck happened yeah but we don't know the discussion that was had like hey uh you're gonna happen to ring and you're gonna do this and you're gonna throw four punches and this is you know dude we don't know yeah there was another video of them saying that you could hit him for real beforehand but I don't think they explained to him like hey don't but to get even yeah yeah because there's a fucking code and wrestling where if you go too hard you're allowed to go hard back to like get even a pair yeah well I mean here here's another you know 10 foil possibility that the whole fucking thing could be a stunt bro you know like the whole fucking thing I know who the motherfucker is now yeah that's what I'm saying like I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's a publicity stunt I'm saying that's just another likely possibility I don't know dude that guy's head was I mean he was fucking yeah yeah you know I mean they would have let him go you to kill them yeah for sure yeah for sure you know dude it sucks man it sucks you know I'm curious to see what what comes out of this yeah here's what I do know I'll say this to like there's nobody wins out of this situation nobody nobody wins nobody wins dude chat will be saying man popcorns back it was attempted murder murder period yeah yeah I saw that too apparently Stu is a is a vet PTSD went to wrestling of kind of changes save his life and some might hold man yeah yeah wow man yeah I mean I you know I don't know yeah yeah guys tell us in tell us down in comments what you guys think what do you think what do you make of this situation man I mean if that were in the street woodchipper yeah you know I'm saying yeah but we don't have a place like that there's no place for that kind of shit and civilized society period no there but this is wrestling in its violence and it's the reason people watch it you know people enjoy watching violence it's why looking up dead bodies is one of the most popular things on the internet it's why the UFC is one of the biggest fucking entertainment companies if not the biggest in the world violence you give them saying like it's gladiators shit it's in our DNA bro and clearly this time it got very fucking out of hand and honestly like real talk after watching it it's kind of surprising that you haven't seen it happen before like in wwe or something you know where someone goes a little too hard those off turns into a real fight yeah cuz like that's that's what happens I mean fights happen like that where you're fucking around and someone gets a little too hard and then escalates yeah right right you know and that I mean most fights that I've seen happen happen because of some sort of escalation of you know or exactly yeah yeah that's real man guys let us know down in comments what you guys think we love to hear you take on it let us know man and you know prays to stew hope he does recover well and fast man yeah look I don't have all the details I guess that's why I need to do I yeah need I need to do it I think it's gonna come out yeah I think it's one of these things we got it we got to let it we got to kind of let it see what happens yeah that's real man yeah well guys it's time thumbs up thumbs fuck final segment guys know how it goes um got something got some stuff you to grade huh I got got some stuff you to grade to rate okay we're gonna rate things rate things yeah okay um and I know

richest people in the world yeah fucking hip hop motherfuckers they didn't got no money you're not him pal you're not him though those motherfuckers pretend to be me yeah that's right you know what I'm saying that's right like unless you're Jay Z or whatever yeah that's different yeah Rick Ross big dogs uh Lewis Hamilton he has a Paganis Zonda yeah got wrecked did it really yeah by him wrecked right there in that photo oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't I don't think he wrecked it it wasn't him though yeah that's a that's a fucking cool car though how much is that thing costs uh those the Zondas right now can be like six to ten good gosh good lord um jeez uh make me more than that yeah there's few that are like special editions that are more than 20 up until 20 they no no that's an exaggeration on the internet okay and nothing on the internet's real that's my that's my under well dude that's what I'm saying the car culture on the internet is like there's a lot of myths you know like they will people will say oh dude you know how you you get in with Ferrari you got to make X amount of dollars and you got to fucking suck all these dicks and do all this shit no you have to have a diversified portfolio of cars that goes from classic to production to what they call vs and all these other like it's not what the the internet very rarely gives out the proper information because all the information that's given out is given out by people have never experienced the process so you get like all these car podcasts and all this shit that are inaccurately representing some of the things that go into the in the car ownership yeah you know we were done in Houston uh I forget who they said it was but like to your point about it's not to be just about having money no they do try to go in and like buy fucking Ferrari cash it's about the culture do you buy into the culture do you do you are your true collector of Ferraris and if you are a true collector of Ferraris then they will give you the collectible Ferraris but you have to build that portfolio you can't just walk in and say I want a fucking 812 comp and get one that's not how the fuck it works and by the way it shouldn't work that way because they sell you the car it's sticker and then your cars were double the amount the day you get it so if you buy all the fucking production shit and earn your way in which is on a point system you start to profit from collecting the cars so why the fuck would they not make it so the people who are most passionate about the brand can make the most money being passionate about the brand yeah and everybody talks shit and they're like oh yeah that's because they're on the fucking outside you know what I'm saying like waiting for mouth out yeah like it's cold out there bro in here it's cool you know I'm saying like is it true that they say that if you buy Ferrari and you modify it a lot they would not never give it there's people there has been people that have been banned from Ferrari like I think it was DJ was a marshmallow or whoever had the fucking cartoon shit on the outs anyway the point is is that yes there are people that get banned but and and by the way that's that's kind of how all of them work but most of them do it unsuccessfully Ferrari does it actually pretty good you know a lot of people are critical about some of the cars they're making right now with the EV but I assume that's gonna go back because people are you know people are demanding naturally aspirated engines so we're gonna have a I think a movement back towards the classic type Ferrari's meaning you know naturally aspirated big B12's V8's that put out a lot of fucking power make a lot of noise that people like and you know so you could be frustrated with you know how they're doing things right now but at the end of the day man it's it's their company and they can do whatever the fuck they want and people are always gonna want their shit because their brand equity with people is very high so I like that it's like the same the you know it's not just the standard of the brand but like they hold their customers to a certain state yes yeah that's real yeah and like you know what everybody they they've got to figured out bro I've learned a lot from being around that company for a number of years and they treat their customers that are that are loyal very fucking well if you walk in there and you say I want this and that I got money they're gonna tell you you fucked they don't like that shit no and I wouldn't like that shit either you know so you know if Ferrari wanted to be fucking how does I'm sure they could sell some more cars but the Ferrari that's right you know what I'm saying so anyway keep moving yeah speaking of Ferrari Eric Clapton yeah who is that guitar player I got it okay musician he has a Ferrari SP12VC those are sick bro so that's a one-off cars so they will make one-off cars for their top customers that's a big time for our oh yeah apparently yeah it has to be it won't just do it for I couldn't get one made no shit yeah so like that that's a one-off car mm-hmm cheese yeah 4.7 million yeah approximately yeah and they've made some really cool shit like one-off no shit yeah custom built for him yeah now that's a true custom built factory car that's who got he does that too we got he will make one-off cars that no one else fucking has jeez but I mean who don't call you're gonna be rich as fuck you know and you're probably swinging a pretty big dick yeah I'm saying that's pretty big yeah let's go back to Rolls Royce they did a chrome heart sex Rolls Royce Cullinan for Drake yeah I don't know if that's from I don't think that's from rolls but it could be do that sounds like jesus bought fucking I think I think that's uh that's again aftermarket shit yeah yeah maybe chrome hearts did it with Drake I don't know but I'm can you find any information I could find out yeah let me couple calls but who knows oh look cool yeah what's cool is anymore yeah Jay Leno he has a GM eco-jet concept car from do you know the story behind that one yeah um so I got a grateful dead sticker on the front is that what that is in the grill oh no anyway yeah looks like a Cadillac almost yeah um we got James Glicken Hoss yeah I don't know who that is yeah he has a Ferrari P45 yep that's real yeah what is that is that another one off custom made one off yeah he makes his own cars too who is that American filmmaker and financier yeah I was a filmmaker looking house yeah he's a huge car collector he makes his own shit too no shit that's crazy and then finally they got dt on here he has the Cadillac one the beast yeah which I mean every president technically had yeah but yeah yeah yeah not bad no I mean look dude it's it's a huge honor to be even invited to to purchase a custom car from one of these manufacturers so and like some of the richest fucking most powerful people in the world you know the motherfuckers that you don't know their names yeah that are driving 600 foot yachts across the motherfucking ocean and then you go to Monaco and there's a thousand of them and you don't know who the fuck they are those are motherfuckers they get those cars yeah it ain't a fucking rapper okay it ain't like it was vert yeah that's real man all right well I mean I can see him do a sum for Drake Drake's big time yeah but like but he got that fucking Drake had a lot of money yeah he's got that $200 million fucking jet he just bought fucking he just bought who's changing the Dubai to fucking two pox chain how much oh no price on it yeah it was like yeah the death row chain I mean Drake's one of the most popular artists ever yeah the category you can love him or hate him but the fucking dude who was the last time Drake had a problem selling a ticket to anything well they say it was only it was like half a million yeah for the chain my first form chain was half a million yeah half a million it was he drinks yeah I love it man well guys the custom Bugatti's they're making her fucking sick have they always done that now it's kind of a new thing they're doing they started doing concepts and then now they're actually they've opened up this program where you can like actually design I don't know the details because I haven't talked to him about it yeah but for their better customers which there's not that many because most people own one Bugatti right but there's dudes that collect them you know and I get why because the fucking there's nothing like it pretty sick when you wrote oh there's nothing like it I was talking to my buddy Hayden who uh just sold they just sold their company and he bought a sheeran and he was like holy fuck I'm like I know dude like you can't explain it you can't fucking explain it as fast as I took you in that car imagine like three times faster than that since where you can't fucking you can't actually yeah I can't it's ridiculous so and by the way they're comfortable and they you could you could drive across the country and one and be comfortable like it's pretty if I stop for gas a couple times yeah yeah yeah you suck gas you remember when I only filled yours up like halfway yeah yeah they do they do go through the gas yeah yeah anyway yeah well guys hey de chat that's all I got yep all right guys we will see you later on this week don't be a
