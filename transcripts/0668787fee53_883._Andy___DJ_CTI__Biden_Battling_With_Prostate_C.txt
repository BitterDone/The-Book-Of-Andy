terms of reading everything online so when I come in here I'm just kind of finding out as as probably a lot of listeners are finding out yeah for sure man so they're working on some real big stuff yeah real big you want to share with the class nope not yet but I promise you they're going to be blown the fuck away yeah well I got some to share for the class yeah what's that it's a pull-up date a pool so you're gonna try this again oh no no I learned my lesson I learned my lesson okay um and technically it's a pond update because the pool turned into a pond yeah it's still up I took it down yesterday okay yeah we took it down you had it up that whole time yes yes yes that was like a year yeah bro bro I was raising tadpoles and shit man boy it just sat there yep it didn't start sticking in shit it did it well you just dealt with it it unless you're fucked with it it did yeah but like I mean I was like keeping the mosquitoes and shit at bay I put like mosquito pellets shit in there so instead of just taking it down you just medicated it well no the problem okay to to my defense this has been an unusual there's no defense season right a lot of rain and so like by according to my calculations of the pool we've had at least like four feet of rain four feet at least okay that's how full it was pretty cool yeah but I pumped it all out man um was it full of the very top damn near it's halfway yeah halfway so wait damn near it's halfway damn near it's halfway that's all right that's all right so that's that's how accurate your mathematical calculations are huh damn near equals halfway that's my halfway I got it one by one half yep that's right and uh this is some I've never learned this math if you guys ever is this the math you guys learned where you learned that well it's no one too you ever like I know you know I'm saying like that that that means you close yeah I know yeah all right all right buddy hey listen here pal yeah that's right you guys got it you know I'm saying it's over there hey listen here buddy yeah I've had it up to here with it yeah that's like that's like three-fourth floor you know you're on my last nerve but yeah man so I had to pump all that shit out and what did they say in India Z-Shine what do you say don't touch my crickets that's my hole not my gutty all right right start off with some good old fashion American race it's allowed it's all right five minutes in but yeah man so I got pulled down we got both pickup coming so like they'll get it all out just left that shit by the curve both pickup huh yeah that's a new thing for me bro like I'll be real like five years in in the county you know I'm sending the suburbs like I'm still getting used to it the bulk pickup yeah bro like in our day bro I mean back in my day back in my hood bro just or still that shit in the alley bro yeah we're where it is we're fucking where bro how do you think white flight started yeah bro this is I mean like it was new bro like I think we'll be first moved in our house but I'll just used to get on me all the time because I'd leave my trash cans up yeah like for fucking days like I'm a fuck you know I'm sending that till I realize it was rude you know yeah yeah they neighbors get mad they they look down on their foot they're around yeah they got me a check you know yeah they're they're they're they're fucking moving back for me oh I'm gonna be like two days man come on man they're leaving fucking DVDs and Django on the fucking front porch oh shit man they taught me they taught me quick but it is what it is man um all right yeah but what's going on dude well I wanted to bring this up first because you know I know you've been getting a lot of people checking on you checking on us and saying Lewis oh yeah I'm the fucking tomatoes and stuff dude yeah man fuck I just highlight it real quick yeah I mean cuz dude yeah it was it's been bad yeah yeah dude I mean dude it passed right by here I had no idea we were in a recording we were in a recording here's how bad it was real talk we were in a recording the tornado sirens went off and we kind of joked about it we were like oh well it looks like we're gonna get sucked up you know like right we were joking right having no idea like how close it was yeah and then Shelby took that picture uh I saw you you posted on your story yeah we throw it up in here you could look at it but I mean dude it went right by the building yeah and then um you know I had the guys take the comment out because I didn't know that like it's fucking smashed our city dude and dude it's it's really bad yeah it was uh it was uh the categorized as an EV3 tornado um they ripped through five people have been killed uh buildings collapsing I mean and like dude it hit it was like there was no this dimmin uh discrimination on where it went right I could hit high areas it hit low areas man and like they were both equally fucked up yeah um you know but one of the things that that and then to date like I checked this there's still about 30,000 people without power right yeah we were out we were out in my house for about uh 36 hours yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like yeah like yeah two full days damn there yeah yeah um but dude I mean it was bad man it was bad I got some pictures here from from uh from some of the uh the areas had been affected man but you know one thing we talk about like listen St. Louis has this problem man we we have we have our issues but one of the things that like I've been really happy to see is the community outreach yeah the community engagement mm from all from from from all places yeah like from from businesses our our cardinals organization blues um local restaurants like every church yeah bro we had a ton of guys down all the way since out like fucking I think we got another crew down there day going down a day of four yeah I'm gonna try to get down there with them but it's just like um we sent uh we I mean do the sports shots yeah we were running pro you know supplies down to everybody working all day yesterday and then also had guys work it but like dude yeah I mean bro look man you know uh at the end of the day Americans are Americans and especially here in St. Louis dude like I you're right like we do have a lot of shit a lot of problems but I mean dude right now no one gives a fuck and it would be nice if we could all remember that you know what I'm saying like after after the after this is yeah remember this like dude we see you know we're seeing a lot of white people up in the black neighborhoods you know helping we're seeing a lot of black people in the white neighborhoods helping and everybody's you know working together and it's it's uh it's really nice to see man like it really is it's been a long time since we've had that in St. Louis yeah well I mean like it doesn't think like it's unheard of really like a tornado in the city like yeah it's kind of hurt of like yeah really like that's why we we we play it off sometimes we hear that like it's normal for us you know I'm saying like it's very rarely does it actually like fucking do shit you know yeah it's uh yeah I mean dude the they're not portraying the damage properly on on television um it's bad yeah and it kind of makes you wonder like uh you know all of these these situations they're not you know like what will happen in Asheville or what happened in Hawaii and they they I mean dude it's bad and uh fucking I don't know you know there's always something that good that comes out of it but yeah St. Louis is a resilient city it's a very tough city people here are are very tough and uh you know it is cool to see everybody working together I mean I think it's a refreshing for me yeah for sure dude for sure um but yeah I mean had to put that update in and we're fine you know yeah I mean dude there's a lot of people that that are hurting right now without without homes right now I mean um it's tough man but we I'm sure we'll get through it I know we'll get through yeah that's what saying it was being a St. Louis and does that say right yeah and that's what it's about man you know one of the things that sucks dude is like our we have a very old very charming architecture in yeah in St. Louis and a lot of it got fucked up and like dude I just hope they don't rebuild it oh with this gay and shit yes yes brutalism cracker box modern bulls yeah like bro put it back how it is like stone and beautiful architecture and and you know the things that make our city unique I saw this interview from one of the parks up in uh north side and the guy was like dude you know we can rebuild all this but what sucks is is like our park is now all the trees are gone and it changed the landscape yeah it's just you know I don't know man that part always sucks yeah you know for sure for sure yeah man well you know you know you don't have to say and it has a vibe it has a culture and like I don't nobody wants it to look like one of these newer cities where everything just looks like a fucking strip mall yeah no character to it for sure yeah man so I mean we'll keep you guys updated it had to do a little single subdate um yeah I mean yeah yeah we'll keep you guys updated on it uh but yeah with that though let's get into some of our our topics our headlines we got a lot of stuff happening um there's a lot happening so let's dive into us connect some dots remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy forsella.com you guys can find them link there or come check us out on YouTube uh you guys can follow along as well um watching our beautiful faces with this being said headline uh number one stop into uh we got Uncle Joe sleepy Joe Biden in in the news everybody's talking about it Biden breaks his silence after revealing he's battling aggressive prostate cancer we are strongest in the broken places whatever the fuck that means um farmer president Joe Biden posted a smiling selfie early Monday morning as he sent thanks for the support he's received since revealing his battle with aggressive prostate cancer quote cancer touches us all the 82 year old wrote on social media along with the photo of him sitting besides his wife Joe Biden in their cat this is the picture um the cat looks like it's fucking miserable I'm not gonna lie I mean I'm not even a cat person I feel for it you know what I'm saying yeah um but yeah he posted that out and uh you know he's been getting support uh you know good well wishes from everybody um you know all the obvious players tampon 10 put out there Gwen and I are praying for president Biden and his family a truly decent man and a friend we're wishing him all the best you got Elizabeth Warren in there kind of a common a Harris of course she she reaches out jasmine crocket I mean you even getting some from Donald Trump Donald Trump junior right they're posting on it you know uh politics aside we wish him a speedy recovery um everybody's been been been kind of putting it out there you know putting their their their their respects and their wishes uh for president uh former president Biden Michelle no barok they also jumped in the mix um barok Obama posted this Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its farm forms than Joe and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace we pray for fast and full recovery um how nervous do you think Michelle is you think she's gonna get like I'm very like a emergency checkup I had to I had to I know I'm sorry I had to I can book him on me I can pass that out yeah she's nervous this fuck right now you know what they say Michelle and I both know how hard this must be I don't know man but but here's the thing so I mean you know you call them conspiracy theories you call them whatever you want um it's interesting because a lot of people have said that this man has not been well for a long time um in fact he said it a few times um let's go back to 2022 because he did a press conference a little press briefing um where he claimed he claimed the ad cancer and immediately um KGB uh you know the press secretary at the time like everybody jumped on and oh he was just misspeaking he was just misspeaking yeah right um here's the original clip from that press conference let's check this out my mother drove us and rather than us to be able to walk and guess what the first frost you know what was happening you've had to put on their windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window that's why I and so damn many other people I grew up have cancer and why can't for the longest time Delo were the highest cancer rate in the nation yeah and so just immediately after that everybody's updated oh no no white house officials sell poetry was he referring to a past removal of skin cancer right by the mistake of he stated present tense that he has cancer but it's interesting because a few weeks before that he used the same exact story but instead of saying cancer he said it was asthma have you seen that yeah let's check this one out and I we I went to a small little school that was about a mile from the apartment complex we lived in and a little school called Holy Rosary and I you couldn't walk to school because although it was a four-lane access highway it was just too dangerous to cross some of the streets and my mother would get them and when it came spring I mean it came in the fall this is the god's truth and you get in the car and a little frost on the window turn on the windshield wiper there'd be an oil slick not a joke I have asthma and 80% of the people who in fact we grew up with have asthma I just in an apartment complex when we moved to Delaware and just up the road to a little school I went to Holy Rosary grade school and because it was a four-lane highway that was accessible my mother drove us and rather than us being able to walk and guess what the first frost you know what was happening it had to put on the windshield wiper to get literally the oil slick off the window that's why I and so damn many other people I grew up have cancer so this is weird it is weird and now there's been a bunch of doctors jumping in on this because you know all the details are already a stage for prostate cancer very advanced right um and doctors have been jumping on this and like that's like it's impossible for that to just come out as a surprise diagnosis because you know the doctors they know cancer they know how the shit works like you've had to have that for years well you would have to have it for years and not be checked which he was the president of the United States and obviously gets checked all the time every year right let's check out this doctor talking about this is Dr. Zik uh let's check him out think you're a you're an oncologist uh obviously uh incredibly respected you you believe that it is likely I just for those just tuning in you believe it is likely if this prostate cancer has spread to the bone that he could have had it for up to a decade. But certainly it's likely, would it be fair to say, it's likely to have had this for at least several years. Oh, more than several years. You don't get prostate cancer. I just want to stop you. So this is not speculation. If you have prostate cancer that is spread to the bone, then most certainly you are saying had it when he was president of the United States. Oh yeah. He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that. Hmm. Very interesting. All right. Now, I think the timing of all of this is also interesting. And I think it warrants some looking into because over the weekend something got released. And it was the audio recordings from his interview with a special prosecutor, her, Robert Herr, about all the documents and shit that he was taking when he was not president. All of that came out which without a doubt revealed he was not fit just mentally. Now they're covering like, I don't know. How are you seeing this? What do you make of all of this? Well, I mean, look, man, there's, you know, there's many different ways this could be. And unfortunately, we don't trust anything. So we have to break everything down of what it actually could be and then deduce what it probably is. It's most likely. Like we had to do since, you know, I don't know for us, it was since COVID started. You know, that's when it became clear to me that we were being lied to about not just COVID, but a lot of different things. And so, you know, when I hear this, my first thought while you were reading it was, well, okay, maybe that makes sense as to why he would do a cap on his day at 11 a.m. You know, maybe he was being treated behind closed doors. They kept his secret. That makes sense because, you know, the therapies that they use take a lot out of you. Yeah, for sure. And it's usually, you know, like it's a, it's a daily thing. You know, I've had family members have to go through that and it's not easy. And so I was thinking about that, right? And I was, you know, and how much he was absent from the press briefings and all of these things. I mean, that was all. Yeah. So that's what I was thinking when you first brought it up. But, you know, then these audio things come out. And right afterwards, you know, this comes public that he's got cancer. And I also find it hard to believe personally that these people don't have internal remedies for these diseases. I do not believe that we as American citizens get the actual cures. I don't think we get the treatments. Yeah, we, they have cures, but we don't get them 100% and the reason for that is business, right? We hear it everybody, you know, it would, it would collapse the medical care racket. So, you know, I think that that's a personal belief in mind for a long time. And then I think, okay, well, if they have that, why aren't they giving it to him? And, you know, and it probably has something to do with they want him to go away. Yeah. We can't prosecute a dead man. Yeah. And then also he can't dead, dead people can't talk. So it could be that, it could be surface level. It could be, you know, yeah, they hit it and he's got cancer and that's it. But it's interesting how none of these other people as prevalent as cancer is to, you know, my family, everybody else's families. I don't know people. It's interesting how none of these older people that are high level political figures ever seem to die from cancer. They live until they're, you know, really, really, really old, you know, you know, like, look at him. I mean, I don't know, I don't know what to think, bro. Like, I, you know, it's not good karma in my opinion to wish someone to suffer and die of cancer. So I don't have anything to say regarding that. I think he's a criminal. I think it's very convenient that all of a sudden he has this. I think it's weird that, you know, he wasn't offered what cure they have because I know, dude, I'm, I don't know that people are going to say, well, how do you know they have? I just, that's just what I believe. So, you know, yeah, that could be bullshit, but I don't think it is. Um, so I mean, yeah, that's kind of what I'm taking from it. It does, it's very coincidental that these audio recordings, um, drop and then all the sudden, this comes out right away. You know what I mean? No, dude, what do you think? Yeah, I mean, 100% dude. My thing is I think they use, they, they used Biden for exactly what he was used for, right? And where the mental decline happened when he became, you know, the innocent, sweet old grandpa, I don't know, but I know that he went into it, understanding his role in this whole fucking scheme. Yeah. And the amount of damage that this man has caused to this country in the time period that he's been in positions to do so because it wasn't just, you know, his, his last, his first term as president, no, it goes back to when he was a VP, he went back to when he was a fucking senator. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But like the amount of damage that this man caused, he was aware that he was going to be chosen to do this and do exactly what he did. Where, where the decline happened? I don't know. But personally, I think if this cancer thing is real, because I'm not doubting that it is, but you know, it's, it's real cool. That's, that's the lightest punishment he could possibly have in my opinion. And I'm just being real, bro. Yeah. I mean, look, I don't even want to talk about the cancer. These people are fucking traders and they deserve a trader's punishment. And yeah, I agree with you. I think it's, I agree with you. I don't, I don't want to sit here and talk bad about. Not someone with cancer. But yeah, I agree with you. He deserves a trader's punishment, not, not cancer. It's too convenient. And now you got like, you know, the auto pinchets being brought up, like being looked into you. Yeah. Like, you got Trump talking about it openly. And so it's like, it seems like, dude, it really does feel like a lot of things are starting to materialize. To roll. And you know, I considered a lot of, you know, like, you know, after we do a show, I always think about, you know, okay, what do, what am I really seeing this right? Or, you know, and, and I started to think about Trump. And you know, Trump's so polarizing, even amongst people on the right. Because a lot of people think, you know, like me, he's not doing enough. A lot of people think he's just another puppet. I don't think that's the case, but I could be wrong. You know, a lot of people, you know, say, well, why doesn't Andy say that the Republicans and the Democrats aren't two wings of the same bird? I fucking say that all the time, dumbass. If you listen to the show, you don't understand that. Do you want me to say it exactly how you say it? Here we go. Here we go. The Democrats and the Republicans are two wings of the same fucking bird. Same bird. Are you happy? Okay. Like, fuck, dude. You know, with that being said, I believe that there are people inside of. The center, a few on the left and handfuls on the right, who just are patriots. Okay. And they are really just, they're in the party, but they're not in the party. And so we have a mix of different things. And it's to be determined where I believe Trump fits in those categories. Because in my mind, these things should be happening much faster. However, there are other points to consider, such as it takes a while to get the cases completely locked tight so that these people can't beat it in court. Because if Trump's been consistent about one thing, it's the fact that he wants to maintain at least the majority of the structure of the United States. The integrity of it. That's correct. And I don't actually agree with a lot of that. I mean, I think that the cancer has to be cut out at whatever cost because that's actually constitutional. It says so. Yeah. So there's lots of ways to look at this. But with him starting to bring out some of these things about the auto pen and, you know, it makes me think, oh, okay, well, they didn't just forget about it. Yeah, right. You know what I mean? They're tracking it for sure. Yeah. You know, all these different people saying different things, but it does seem like the language is starting to materialize. So we'll see, man, like I just, listen, I just don't make a judgment until it's done. So see what happens. It is weird, man. I think it's just too convenient, man. I don't know. Guys, I want you to jump down in the comments. Tell us what you guys think. Let us know. Again, I mean, it's not bad wishing on anybody's health, right? No, but I hope he survives so that he can be strung up and his head could be put on a state. How about that? That's what I think. How about that fucking bird? Yeah, because dude, listen, he deserves a traders punishment. The guy is a trader. His a lot of these people with traders, a lot of them. Okay. They intentionally destroyed our country and intentionally, all right? They need to be dealt with as such. That's my opinion. Yeah. One hundred percent, man. Guys, let us know. Let's go check out some of these comments, man. We got some comments to cruise through. Let's cruise the comments. This first comment comes from Becca Love, 1964. Why was the Theo Von Video kind of hot? I want him to do that to my neck. Well, that's because you're programmed to find masculinity attractive. You might be a little fucked up. Nobody has any other bad issues there. Yeah. But hey, I always say that's a fairly common thing for women to be into. Jesus. Good Lord, Becca. Hey, you know what? These girls, it's been so long since they've seen any male aggressors. Some shit. They forget that shit turns them on. That's why all you little pussy's out there that like, you know, supplicate and fucking can't say no and have man titties. Bro, it ain't happening for you, man. Like they don't want another girl. They want a man. I don't know why I keep getting put in the friend zone. Well, that's because you act like a fucking friend. They can act like a fucking girl. They smell your estrogen. Yeah, man. All right, Becca. Well, yeah. Dude is crazy looking around like real talk. It is. It's fucking crazy to me. How little men put it into. They're. Product. They're manhood. Yeah. Like it's like, and then they try to make fun of people that actually live to a standard. Like, dude, I see all these dudes who are like in their 40s now who you that I, you know, they used to be like in shape and now they just look like a fat turd with no arms and a fucking, you know, grim as belly and like it's just like, dude, you're not even trying. Like you're not even fucking trying, bro. Like what message are you sending to your sons? You know, and then you talk to him. It's like, well, you know, it's a fucking dad life. No, dad life should mean you're jacked. Dad life should mean you're living the standard. It should mean that you're showing your sons and your daughters what it means to be a man so that your son's emulated and your daughters won't tolerate anything less than that. That's what dad life should be about. And you know, walking around with a fucking, you know, micro, brew, IPA, acting like you're all fancy with the grim as belly and you're fucking golf outfit looking like shit. Bro, you said a terrible example and I don't know what it is like it's just gross. Back it on with that. Huh? No, women don't want that at all. No women wants that. Only insecure women want that so they can boss them around. That's real. That's real shit. Alright, Becca, we'll, uh, you'd be good out there. Becca. Um, this next one is from locally hated wraps. I'm going to school today to see the principal because my nine year old used a word mother loving and you guessed it. I'm going to wear that bison hat loud and proud to the meeting mother loving. Yeah, I think they got it from here. What's wrong with that? I don't know. Yeah, it sounds like schools got their, uh, what that isn't that better than like mother fucking it'd be better. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, like we're trying to set examples here too, bro. I mean, is that insane? The principal's calling on crazy? Yeah, that's so crazy. Yeah, at the same time, they're like little steve is actually Stephanie. You're right. Yeah, right. But that's fine. Yeah, you don't call parents on that one. Right. Yeah, fucking. It's talks with an F. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's what we got to worry about. Yeah, last one, man, home of the hustle, uh, instead of bubble gum, Andy is the OG Bubba Spud. That's right. I like mashed taters. I like fried taters, baked taters, soup taters. I could go on and on and on. I could go on and on and on. That's pretty good. But yeah, that's me. Fucking Tater King. You call me the emperor of taters. The Tater Emperor. What else? Tater Emperor. Tater King. Tater King. You got a Tater General. The Tater General. It was really good at this. Joe, what do you got?

They teach you that one and when you came over here, they say here's the dad jokes. Yeah, right. Yeah. I didn't even got that one, bro. That's shit. Man, damn. All right, man. Guys, we do appreciate you for being real ass fans and, uh, mother loving fans. Yeah. Appreciate it, man. Let's keep it cruising, go ahead and line up to something else that happened over the weekend. Let's go to CNN, because I like their headline on this. I think it was the best one. James Comey's weird social media approach lands him in hot water. Okay. Don't you love CNN? No. Like what's weird about calling for the execution of the president? It's super weird. Yeah. So get into it. There's another thing about this that's like no one's talking about. Really? Yes. Well, let's dive into this. James Comey, he is the former director of the FBI. He decided to put a now deleted Instagram post up over the weekend. This was the post here. It's a picture. If you guys are with an audio, it's a picture of, I guess he's on a beach. They're saying and then there's some seashells. They are arranged in the numbers 86 47 with a caption that goes cool shell formation on my beach walk. Right? Now, it took minutes. Okay. Minutes before people started getting on there and putting two to two together and coming to their conclusions. And then roughly, I mean, almost immediately afterwards. He pulled the picture down and posted this as a reply. I'm saying I posted, I posted earlier a picture of some seashells. Last all today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence and never occurred to me, but I opposed violence of any kind. So I took the post down. Yeah, I opposed violence of any kind. The fuck out of here. Yeah. And we're all stupid, bro. You're so smart. You know, you're so smart because you were the head of the FBI. You're so much smarter than everybody else in the whole country and world. And you can sneak these very slick jokes underneath our radar. And we'll never notice because we're just a bunch of dumb, the Androphils. That's the arrogance is what it is. Yes. He knew. He knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what the fuck he was saying. Okay. But did you know this? Did you know that the day he posted that where it said 86 47 was exactly 8,600. 47 days since 9, 11. No shit. Yes. On the exact day he posted that. So not only was it 86 47, you know, 86 for you guys means, you know, cut out. 47. Yeah. Okay. But it was posted on the exact day 8,647 days since 9, 11. Who do you think the significance of that? I think it's a fucking threat, dude. I think it's a threat. The threat of intentional terrorism that will somehow kill Donald Trump. That's what I think it is. Fuck. Yeah. Hmm. I mean, dude, listen, because listen, they're not going to be able to assassinate him. Like they would assassinate Reagan or how they tried to assassinate Reagan or how they get with you. Okay. No, they're going to create some massive attack that's going to, you know, he wasn't the only one that posted that day. I tried to find those a few other. Well, dude, this is a, this is a message that the paid protesters that are financed through people like George Soros consistently protest with. They put on their signs. They enough. Yes. 47. Yes, dude. Dude. It's sick, man. And like, and the thing is like, bro, like, it only takes a few bit. Like guys, I highly advise you go do this. Go to his social media handles. He's on Instagram. He's on Twitter. Go look at the shit he's posting. Call me. Yeah, call me because it's not like, I mean, this was, I mean, bro, like he posted a bunch of shit that's just like, you know, very clear that this guy has some issues, man. America should be thankful. Good people stood up for the rule of law today. Respective prosecutors refused to do the dirty work of unethical trumpers. I'm sorry for the pain. Grateful for the example. And thankful. So many public servants will try to stay and protect the public and our institutions. We posted this with Donald Trump isn't coming for us. The rule of law is coming for him. Months before you won the war. Yeah, it's all projection gaslighting. Superb. All of the actually. But then you look into it a little bit. You know, yeah, yeah, I know, dude, right? You know, we posted this. Proud dad. Listen, this guy, these people are out of control. They're out of fucking control. And they, like I've been saying, man, you gotta cut the cancer out of them. You know what's crazy to about this? I don't know if you knew this, but so he, so since he's left, he's also been writing some books, some novels, right? Some, some, some fiction novels, I guess you could call it. And his latest book that he just wrote out, which he's been posting here regularly is, is titled FDR Drive. It's a crime novel. Guess what this book is about? This book is about a far right wing extremist podcast or that's putting out some bleminal messages to target. Really? Bro, real shit. So he wrote about us. He wrote about us. Yeah, man. Sweet. Yeah, yeah, right here. Look, it's about a US attorney, Carmen Garcia, trying to take down Samuel Buchan in a far right media personality with the popular podcast, vilifying those he thinks are destroying America, intellectuals, immigrants, and people look at, yeah, that's how it's all about. Damn, dude. This is great. This is great. Man, we're, yeah, best. What are they, what are they, what are they? I wonder if he wants us to sign them. Yeah, he's, he puts out, it puts out content, it goes far beyond the protection of first amendment. He's single hours, his enemies by name. That's a big one we talk about. Right. And suggested something should be done about them. Oh, yeah, something should be done. Yeah. His fan, my name, I mean, we're talking about like what Hillary Clinton, Obama's, Obama's, combing, sorrows, you know, like, Files Schwab. Yeah, I mean, is that the list we're talking about by this man? Yeah, Fauci. Fauci, you know, and where's the, something was be done. Yes. Man, he really is talking about us. But yeah, he's writing out a book about, you know, you putting out some little messages and people act on, right? But you can put out 8647. Or you could develop entire programs like MK Ultra to weaponize manipulation on mentally ill and, you know, mentally compromised individuals who you've created, you know, genders dysmorphia and lack of personal identity and lack of purpose, lack of hope, lack of mission in life to convince these people to actually go shoot people in real life. And then you can give them the guns and, you know, give them the plan. And then when they do it, you just kill them. And then they can't tell you. Like they do that just blew up the IVF clinic. Like, fucking all of them, man, fuck man. Notice none of them ever survived the word they could actually talk. And if they do survive, they lock them away, thousand feet deep so that, you know, nobody could ever reach them, you know, like, you know, this guy that killed or tried to shoot Trump, go into the FBI building dozens of times right next door. We need to talk, let's talk about the FBI, bro, because listen, I mean, this is where it's all connected. The FBI has a new director, cashmatoil, Dan Bangeino is his deputy director. They're getting, they're getting, they're in there in some hot water because they decided they did an interview. I think it was with Fox News, Maria, Bauterama, Bauteramo. And they've pissed off a lot of people. All right, they pissed off a lot of people. The first thing they covered was the Epstein. The Epstein list, the Epstein situation, some of the facts leading up to it. And they both are publicly, you know, claiming that Epstein did in fact kill himself. And that's pissing off a lot of people. Let's check this clip out. This is this is one of clips from the interview. You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. People don't believe it. Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one. And that's what that was. He's lying, killed himself. You again, you want me to get, I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. Okay. You notice how they're both breaking eye contact and looking off when they're saying they're both lying. They're lying. They're both lying. Well, you can tell cashmatoil was lying. I mean, dude, for somebody who's the FBI director, bro, you need to learn how lie a little better. That was a fucking lie. Now, on Geno got all fucking goofy eye too. So for sure. Yeah. And the biggest thing that got going against them is we've been able to see when they say something actually believe for years and years and years and years. That does not, they don't believe that. That is a bullshit. Yeah. For sure. They are being told to say that blackmailed to say that or saying that for an intentional strategy that they're trying to work on. Yeah. I was going to, I mean, because that would be the only logical reason, right? But like the typical response, like just give it, it's an ongoing investigation. Well, you know, give that. Listen, Megan Kelly, who is very, very sharp and very plugged in and also General Flynn, who is very, very sharp and very plugged in, have both talked about Epstein still being alive and that we're going to hear from him in terms of what was actually going on. And they're actually trying to protect him from massage and CIA influence. So or or not influenced, but you know, acid, yeah, right, not being able to be killed by them. Yeah. So, uh, that'd be crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be crazy. You know, but there's a lot of things and like I want to, I want to give a OG shout out real quick. He's one of my, my people I look up to. He had to be careful how to say this. I was Jones. Yeah. Dude, listen, you say what you want about them? Talk about his delivery. He's not right on everything. He's been right on the fucking lot. He, he, he fucking laid it all out. He's bad and above 95% of the things he says at least. And if you say that's not true, then you have not been paying attention and, and dude, there's so many connections like, I mean, this even connects James Comey. You know, I'm saying with this Epstein shit. And he put out a very lengthy tweet on Twitter. And you know, he started, I'm going to read this whole thing. We'll go through it. How, before we go through this, how does cat like what cash, I've been in the, the, the, the, the housing, I've been in the prison. I'm, this, I know a suicide when I see one. Bro, what do you think we are? We think we're fucking stupid. That is not even a close to a justification of why you would know that was a suicide. Well, not only that, bro, they released the autopsy pictures. You know what I'm saying? And that's been fucking looked at by, by investigators, viewer discretion advised. So this is what they released of Epstein during his autopsy, right? But like everybody fucking jumped in at normal hanging literature marks are going to be much higher on the neck. Way to the body going down and got gravity. Dude, we listen. We have no idea what's real or not. That's right. And it's interesting that they, they allowed AI to become public right as all this stuff was happening because now we're in a position where it's almost impossible to tell what is real and what's not. Now, this was from the Megan Kelly show. I mean, she could see your point. She covered it. You know, I'm saying like, it's been out for a minute. People talked about it. You know what I'm saying? It's like to double down on that stance. It does lead to like what the fuck? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But I want to read Alex Jones his, his tweet on this because like I said, he breaks it down pretty decently in my opinion. And he starts off saying overall, I think cash would tell him, damn, my, you know, doing a great job. But on this claim that Epstein's death is not a cover up. I call bullshit. Epstein confirmed a suicide question mark. Maria sits down with FBI's cash, we're telling down by a, a, Bungino who claim Epstein did in fact commit suicide. Now let's get into why people do not believe this theory. Number one, Marine Comey, farmer disgraced FBI director James Comey's daughter was in charge of Epstein's alleged suicide investigation. She isn't a good start. And Marine allegedly lost the jailhouse CCTV tapes as a result of a technical error. Then on top of the lost, slashed, erased tapes through a technical error, both security guards quote unquote, fell asleep who were supposed to be watching Epstein sale, who was on 24 hours of valence for a suicide watch, which is standard procedure in every jail and being a high profile prisoner. There are rumors in a video you can search, which claims notchic, uh, uh, nitrous oxide was used to knock the guards out, which then Epstein was taken out by another individual. Other claims the guards were paid not to talk. Either way, for the tapes to mysteriously go missing or erased and to not have, uh, and to have not one, but two guards both fall asleep coincidentally. The odds of both of these happenings to occur at the same time in the same place are astronomical. Um, you know, it's even more astronomical. The video tapes for J6 got lost. The video tapes for the, uh, a bunch of these different shootings, the subway shooter got lost, the Nashville shooter, the supermarket shooter, the valedays shooter, right? They all got lost. Okay, it's interesting how every single thing that is relevant to what we're talking about. The state, you know, mysteriously disappear. Mm hmm. It's weird, man. Uh, uh, oh, he's right. Again, like, just looking at stuff, you got comies, daughter, and charge of it when all of these people are implicated and then do whatever, man. Now like I said, now it's like to your point, if he is still alive and they're doing it just to protect him, okay. And we're probably fucking up the plan. I don't know. Well, come out that fucking heart like you're lying to me. Like I, it's hard to even believe because that just doesn't, I don't buy that your reactions all of it. You know what I'm saying? Like, you said, but we got a baseline. We know these guys look like when they're talking about shit. How, how do we know that they won't use AI to make them look like he's alive? Hmm. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, fuck me. Like, dude, we don't have any idea what's going on. And I can tell you this, whoever solves, whoever solves this problem, I'm going to give you a multi billion dollar idea, okay. For those of you that have technical knowledge, whoever solves the problem of authenticating actual video versus AI in a public way, meaning that like the public can look at something right away and say that's AI. So that's not. Yeah. Or a tool that does that perfectly that everybody knows that person's going to win big. You know what I mean? So anyway, just throw that out there because that's not my wheelhouse. It's crazy. But they also talked about, you know, you brought it up. They also talked about the Butler shooting. All right. And I didn't like how they talked about that. I don't know if you see that piece on it. Oh, bro, I didn't see any of the interview. Bro, watch this clip. Check this clip out, guys. And this is Dan Bongino. Who's going to take it over? Check this out. You know what Maria? Stop. Catch. He's lying. Immediately. Already you could tell he's lying. Immediately. Those of you that are listening, you should come watch this clip because you could tell he's lying in the first second. Okay. Go on. You know what Maria? Catch is not kidding. We've been personally briefed extensively on every single detail nugget, tendril of this case. One is actively in court right now. So I'd respect for the case. It's probably more appropriate that I stay quiet on that. However, I'm not going to tell people. What they want to hear. I'm going to tell you the truth. And whether you like it or not is up to you. If there was a big explosive there, there, right? Given my history as a secret service agent and my personal friendship as a director does with the president, give me one logical sensible reason we would not have. If you can think of one, there isn't. I'm not sure there is. In some of these cases that there you're looking for is not there. And I know people, I get it. I understand. It's not there. If it was there, we would have told you. No, that's complete lie. He's lying. That is 100% a lie. That is a lie. If you have any experience identifying when someone's lying, that's a very sloppy lie. All right. On top of that, there's lots of reasons why you wouldn't want to say anything, bro. Maybe you're being blackmailed. Maybe you're being compromised. Maybe your family's being threatened. Maybe they got to you. Okay. Maybe there's a bigger planet play. Maybe you're trying to keep it quiet so you guys can execute what needs to be done. There's all different kinds of reasons. So let's not sit here and gas lives. There's no reason we wouldn't tell you. No, there's a lot of reasons. They don't necessarily mean that you're the bad guy, but there's a fuck ton of reasons, bro. And you sure do look like you're full of shit. So. Well, I mean, they're there, right? But they want us to believe because I got it bullet pointed out. Okay. But they wanted us to believe on this, this butler hill shit or the butler shooting. Is that Thomas Crookes was able to do all of these things on this day. Okay. On July 13th, he was able to fly a drone over the Pennsylvania fairgrounds, got aerial footage of the rally layout on the day of the event, including two hours before Trump took the stage. He got a range finder through security. He evaded law enforcement officers from several different states, local and federal agencies. He somehow climbed up on a roof with his rifle, 450 feet away from Trump. Bear crawled to the perfect vantage. Vantage pointed as bystanders alerted police and was still able to take a shots at Trump. He was able to park a vehicle full of explosives near the Trump rally. Crookes was able to walk around the premises after snipers took a photo of him looking suspicious. A sniper located in the second story window was only 40 feet away from Crookes and didn't neutralize him. And that Trump was still able to take the stage after Crookes was pegged as a suspicious by secret service. And you're trying to tell us that there's nothing there. Yeah. Nothing there. If only two of these fucking points existed. I know. Yeah. And nothing there though, bro, you're crazy. You're there. You're a conspiracy. There's nothing there. Nothing there. Bro, if two of these five points were here, it's one of the things I just said. They got to them, leveraging them, they're threatening them, they're blackmailing them, or there's more to the plan to allow. Yeah. And they're trying to buy themselves some space in terms of the pressure that's coming on them. And then they're going to get people to say, oh man, stop there. Shit. No, it's going to get people to say, bongino and cash are full of shit because, dude, because the public's not going to be that smart to think about that shit like that. You know, they don't give a fuck. Like there's some big elaborate pro. Bro, you're lying to them directly right now. Yeah, that's all they're going to care about. And so it's going to discredit them. It's going to discredit the administration. Listen, I know they're trying to create, I think there's a possibility that they're trying to create lock tight cases. However, that's not what needs to be done because these trials won't matter, bro. They do that's Trump. Yeah, they, that's not how I would do it. So there's too much risk. No, well, Andy, the other piece of it too, bro, like, you know, trying to do this, look, dude, I would lock this motherfucker down and I would arrest every single one of them right now. And I let everybody say, oh, that's this, that's that, that's this. And by the time they were arguing, I'd be, they'd be dead and there'd be nothing to do about it. Yeah. That's it. And like you could say, oh, that's tyrannical. Yes, it is. But it's the only way to actually clean up what it is. And then you would reset and then you would move forward with the plan, which by the way, every single person agrees that the plan makes sense except for people that want to be paid for things that happened 400 years ago, our model is good. We're not running the model. Okay. So that's that. And to run the model the right way, it says very clearly in the preamble that we have a duty as citizens to take the government back when it's compromised. It's very clearly compromised. Trump knows it's compromised and trying to run it through the court system under normal terms is a bad idea. You know, the better idea that you would do to regain the trust of the United States and the producers and the patriots, which is most people, man, this is, we're talking about 80 20, right? Would be to fucking arrest these people, perp walk them, have a military tribunal and fucking hang them and everybody would celebrate and everybody would be like, okay, we can move on. And America would go on and become the greatest version of America. The problem is is we have all these people who are completely corrupt, who have leveraged our system and corrupted our system to their own benefit and to our oppression. And for us, in my opinion, for us to trust the government at all, there has to be that level of accountability. Like we can't just allow these people to make up controversies and, you know, like the steel dossier that ruins the country's dialogue for what's going on nine years now. And then we think of the division and all of these things, these people who created this intentional environment where they paid for judges to go in and not prosecute violent criminals. All of this shit, all of these people that did any of this and like dude, real talk, we're talking about like a hundred people. We're not talking about thousands of people. We're talking about the head of the snake, probably a hundred people globally that need to go in the dirt and everything else will fix itself because the people who were involved that didn't go in the dirt, they will disappear. Watch racism end. It will watch poverty end. It'll end. It will end. All this like fucking all of this divisive shit. Yeah, and it could be done by July 4th. Oh, bro. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, but that's not what they're doing. And I think it's a mistake. That's my personal opinion. I think the other thing to say this quickly on this man is like, you know, Dan, which like I like Dan's content when he was doing this kind of like, yeah, cool, right? You know, it's all right. Like, Dan, you're in a, you jumped into a seat that has zero public trust. Nothing you say as the deputy director will be trusted. And so you're still vying off the credibility of Dan, the, the influencer on the internet. You know what? I never believed everything. I don't believe anything. I've never believed anything that he said. Yeah. I've never had. And because I, he's too close to the machine. Yeah. Former this former that did this knows these people. He's too close. And I'm not saying that is like, I don't think he's a decent guy or a solid, I don't fucking know. But I never just believe anything that he said. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing because you have to like, you were all just trust me. There is no way that bro, we don't trust you. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So like, you can't, can't make that argument from that, that position. Well, look, man, I mean, if that were me and you, I would not expect them to trust me because of all that came before me. So you have to earn that trust through action. And the real action that people want is they want the country cleaned up, dude. They want to see mass deportations. They want to see fences and containment areas and buses and planes and these people going out of the country by the hundreds of thousands a week. All right. They want, they don't care if people are crying or people are upset. Like we, we are to the point where we want to protect the United States of America and not have a compromise by third world cultures or cultures that don't fit here. We are tired of the crime. We are tired of the living and fear. We are tired of the financial oppression. We are tired of the lies. We are tired of the propaganda. We are tired of the intentional division. And we want to clean up and Trump said he was going to clean up and it hasn't happened. And it could happen very fast. I think most people understand that. And that's what we elected him to do. I think most people that voted for Trump wanted him to take drastic harsh action. And I think he's got a lot of people around him now that are saying, oh, you don't want to do that because that'll make that mad. Those people are going to hate him no matter what. Exactly. They're going to hate him no matter what he does. Whether he does it easy or whether he does it hard, it doesn't matter. And if we really want to fix the country, it would be much more effective to do it real hard fast so that people can see the result of what those changes look like for the next three years. And they'll never go back to that. Yeah, well, I mean, listen, Trump's been dropping some shit. And I mean, I don't know. I'm not a fortune teller. I don't know. But it appears that like bro, like shit's moving. It does appear that like he dropped a video on Hillary Clinton. You see that? I did see that. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, he dropped that. Here's a clip. This was posted from Donald Trump's account. Let's check this out. Remember John F. Kennedy, Jr. He was declared the front runner for the New York Senate seat back in 1999. Days later, his plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and his rival Hillary Clinton was elected Senator. Mary Mahoney was a Clinton White House intern. She knew enough of the inner workings of Bill's sexual advancements to be a star witness during the Clinton impeachment trials. She was brutally executed at a Starbucks she was managing in 1997. In 1993, White House counsel Vince Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park near DC. He supposedly killed himself and among a lengthy list of potential foul play, the bullet was never found. I mean, crazy clip. But he posted that. He's been posting these AI generated pictures like, yeah, well, you know what bro? I know he's been posting these AI generated pictures and these pictures to make him look like, you know, we're looking at one right now that has him. With the 1776 around his does that say cute? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was like, bro, he's been posting some weird shit man. Okay. Well, you know, all right. Well, all right, dude. Well, if that's true, then fucking do it. Yeah. Because I'm going to be real, dude. I'm tired of fucking around. You know what I'm saying? I do. Like I'm tired of the fucking around. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the post and you know, these hero images. And all this ego shit, motherfucker, we elected you to fix the fucking shit. You're not fixing it. So fix it. And then you can post whatever king shit you want to put. I don't give a fuck. I really don't. I cheer for bro by the shirt. I wear the most fucking around. Okay. Like, but dude, until you do it, shut the fuck up and do it. That's my opinion. That's real man. That's real guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. That being said, we got third final headline. Yeah. Third final headline. Now we talk a lot about conspiracy. You see, you're familiar with we, we covered the Titanic conspiracy. Yeah. Right? All right. It's not a conspiracy, but we cover the story of the Titanic. Cover the story. Yeah. Did you know that there is an India version of Titanic that happened? No. Well, you laugh it. I didn't know that. I thought the Indian version of the Titanic was when I took a massive poo and then washed it down the toilet. I played little violin while it goes down, you know. What is he, Sean? What? Strette gel. I'm talking serious, man. There was a, there was an Indian Titanic. Okay. It happened. Are you lying? No. I'm not more recent and there's a video of it. Let's check it out. There's zero chance you made this an entire topic. I'm not sure. How did they, how did they, how did they think that it was going to work out? Like, dude, like, who's, who's the one says, oh, yeah, you're good. I'm not getting this man. Come on, man. No, bro, that's like the American version of like the hillbilly's out on the river. You're like, ah, dude, you're good. You're going to float real. You're good, buddy. You're good. Like, you guys got the red decks like that over there. What do you do? You got a name for them? No, just the people who wear slippers. Yeah, they're what, oh, the sandals. Yeah, the sandalware is that 24 out like in the winter and shit. That's right. Got it. Sandal Indians. That's a different kind of Indian. Is that correct? Yes. All right. Yeah, you be careful with those guys. So, so it's one of those guys standing on the dock being like, oh, yeah. Oh, you're good. Yeah. I would not want to go down in that river. Well, I mean, you were drowned. It's not a, I would not drown. Pro. Oh, yeah, buddy. You got this. You're all good. Dragging a bush. They say the, they say the total cost of loss was like $3.47. That's it. That was the unscrupulous. Oh, man. The bird is up. Fucking curry express. It's unscrupulous. Oh my God, dude. Well, I'm not there. No way. Like, how do you look at that and say that's going to work? No, I'm not. You guys were like the smart motherfuckers in the world, bro. That video is not from India. Where's that from? I can tell. I can tell it's not from India. How do you tell? How do you know? When you hear or see some people and you can say, oh, they're American, not, I can say that's not from India. Okay. It's pretty funny video, but it's not from India. I think I saw it say curry express. I don't know. Oh, look at that big dude. Yeah, you're good, dude. What the fuck? The night in my dreams I see from through soy sauce. Oh, man. Oh, man. Yeah. And five. I look how fast it goes down, bro. It would not be quick. Yeah. The song's pretty good. Yeah. It'd probably be cooler if they used that other song, that, you know, the, the one. No, no, no. The, the fuck a popular one. Oh, the, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ing. Yeah, dude. Oh, man. Fuck, man. Oh, man, sorry. But we almost had another Tattana. It happened. They'll put in New York. Do you see the crew on the Mexican navy tall ship? Yes. What's good? This is another fucking real man of genius. Bro! Holy shit man. Dude, this ship was crazy dude. That's like a hundred million dollar boat. And whoever's driving is like fuck, I think we can fucking make this. No fool, I told you we're gonna laugh man. Let's see the video. I think we got it dude. What do you think? Got it, now you fool. Now we just will get you. Get the door, jump down. Nope. Dude. Dude. Dude. Bro, they're lucky that those masks didn't fall down to those people. There's a bunch of people underneath it. There were people on the mask. Oh there were? Yeah bro. No shit, anybody die? No, two people died. Yeah, two people died. No way. Oh bro, yes. Really? They said they were up on the mask. Holy shit. Oh yeah bro. Two people, two sailors were killed. So they got thrown down? They had harnesses on? Yeah. But I mean fuck yeah, a lot of them fucking yeah. Dude, go back and watch it again. Yeah. You can see them. You see the people there? Holy shit. That was a weird one. Holy shit. Dude. There's a dude hanging from the line. Oh my god. Holy shit. Those are all people. Dude, how does that even happen? What dude? Too many md. Bro. Bro. How does that happen? Dude, I have no idea. How do you not know? How do you? Wow. So it's a 150 foot tall Mexican Navy training ship. The bridge had a clearance of like 120 I believe. I think that was the numbers off of it. Yeah, the bridge is like it has a clearance of like 120. So I mean, I don't even know why the fuck it was even trying to go that way to begin with. I don't know. It's sad. Dude. That dude, like I'm not saying this just to be funny. That guy had to be drunk. No, I'm being serious, bro. Because look, do you notice how he comes in at like an angle? At a bad angle. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? And like that's how you would think if you were drunk. Like you wouldn't, you'd be like, oh well maybe if I hit it from an angle. Like for sure, bro. Yeah, for sure. No, for sure. At least that's how I would think. That's what I would do. Yeah, that's what I was if I was fucking shit faced. Like I'd be like, oh no, we got to do. Let's go at it like an angle. Mr. George. Andy, that doesn't make any sense. No, I don't work, dude. We got it. The new guy you got to a giant about. Yeah, fuck man. Yeah, the Mexican president Claudia Shinbom. And that interesting. Very Mexican. Super Mexican. She offered solidarity and support. Quote, we are deeply saddened by the loss of the two crew members of the Chihuahua to Moke. Training ship who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support goes out to the families. She wrote that on Twitter. Saturday night, which is when that happened. Yeah, the ship was built in Bill Biles, Spain. In 1981, it was one of the tall ship braces twice. I mean, it's a beautiful ship. Oh, shit. Wait, so it won two awards for being the tallest ship. And then you tell me, I'm sorry. No, it won the tall ship races. That's a category of racing. To not like the tall ship. Yeah, right. Okay. I might say, just in New York City as part of a promotion for an event next year that celebrates America's 250th birthday. They look early. They had to get that siesta in. So you know, they were drunk again, way too early for a part of the year in a Viz. But the craziest thing on this man is because we know we got rats. You know, I'm saying we got we got people in politics that shouldn't be there. And who do you think they would blame for this for this happening? Trump. Did they? Yes. Shut the fuck up, dude. Senator Schumer. Bro, Chuck Schumer makes a polling claim about the Brooklyn Brooklyn Bridge ship crash. The bridge is fine, by the way. Bridges fine. No, no actual damage to the bridge dude. How did's. Okay. Let's see how he did this. Yeah. Senator Schumer, Schumer questions if doge cuts played a role. And this weekly Sunday morning press conference in the minority leader, Charles Schumer, question whether cuts by the Department of government efficiency or doge may have played a role in the incident quote, a hard to go out to the people of Mexico and those who lost their lives. And who were injured in last night's Brooklyn bridge vessel crash. He says quote, we know that the Trump administration has been meddling in US Coast Guard operations from staffing to command and comms. And I have the general sense of a doge dysfunction in parts of the Coast Guard to put it mildly, Schumer said, after being fully briefed on last night's Brooklyn bridge accident, one thing is very clear. There are many more questions than answers as to how the incident occurred and whether it could have been prevented. Yeah. It could have been prevented with some fucking basic math and some common sense. It's probably some sober fucking driving. Yeah, that's Trump's fault. The driver is shipping. Where do they call it? What do you call me? You like driving a boat? I guess captaining, captaining, sailing, sailing, sailing. Yeah, of course. Some sober sailing, sober sailing. That's what they need it, man. Listen, dude. Yeah, it's this Trump's fault. This Trump fucking Trump's fault, man. Coast Guard. Mexican Navy. Makes sense. Yeah. I don't know, man. Guys, jumping on the conversation. Let us know down in the comments. I mean, real talk, bro, if Trump had deported the do, the accident wouldn't have happened. Bro, I swear to God. I mean, like if we had fucking done the job, I would lose my shit. I'm just saying it comes out. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. And by the way, let's revisit one of the claims that, you know, I don't think you have it in the show, but I do have to say this. Remember, like months ago, when I said what would have to happen in China and what Zishi Paine would have to do that he'd have to give in and all that. Did you see like that he gave in? Yeah. We never covered it on the show. I'm just saying. Yeah. He bent over. He did. Poo bear bit. Just like I told you it would. Yeah, it's right. Yeah, it's a sort of protest and this shit over there. Yeah, millions of people. Yeah. So I told exactly what I said would happen when all these dumbasses were like, indeed if Trump's tear up the Chinese going to fucking kill us. Blin blin blin blin. Do you do? Do you? Like and then what happens exactly what I said and I was only fucking Motherfucker out there saying that yeah. So I'm just going to remind you all. I told you it would happen and it happened exactly like I said and nobody else was saying it at. All everybody else was saying the other shit. All of them. Go find me and other mother fucker that was saying that was what was going to happen. That's real. That's real man, but guys jump down. And I'm going to have to start being that a good one. That's real man, but guys jump down and I'm gonna have to start being that aggressive with it now because nobody wants to like fucking, you know, like you got all these other dudes that are sick three six nine months behind everything we've been saying on the show. And then everybody gets in the comments and like refuses to like let do you know your way behind there bro. You know, how about we get some militant action out here on your guys's behalf of saying hey, sounds like he's listening to fucking real AF. You know, I talked about that six months ago, you know, I'm just saying a two two. Dude, I'm just saying like it's facts. It is what it is. I talk about all this shit before anybody talks about it. And then because everybody it sounds crazy because we're so early and then when it when everybody else catches on they get all the fucking love. You know, like bro. I don't fucking miss man. I don't. I mean a little bit maybe but not much. Yeah. Yeah, man guys jump down the comments. I just know what you guys think that being so let's get to our final second we got thumbs up dumb as fuck. People like our ratings. They do people like a little, you know, I guess the baits on on stuff we've covered food. We've covered a bunch of different things, all the different varieties of taters. There's a new thing going on I guess right now sitting a little virality. So we got to watch the clip and then you can give your answer. Okay. Very simple question. Who is the best rapper alive? A life a life. Let's check these answers. Who's the best rapper alive? It's not broken. Ooh. What about you? Teacher. Wow, we'll take it. Who is the best rapper alive? Eminem. Wow, thank you so much. Who is the best rapper alive? I'm a fucking future. Fucking. Who's the best rapper alive? 21. Who is the best rapper alive? Janicus. Wow. Who is the best rapper alive? That boy, little baby, man, we four pockets full with it, man. Shout out all the rappers in the Bronx. Who is the best rapper alive? Rap, who's the best rapper alive? I think you can't say the line. Wow. Who is the best rapper alive? Eminem, obviously. I would take a thank you. Who is the best rapper alive? Right now, Gunna. Who is the best rapper alive? All the old dogs like Papus. I don't even remember who the fuck that is. Well, that's because you ain't old enough. But I mean, I'm so pro there's some people that they did not fucking name like Jay Z's not going to get named it. All you know what I'm saying? Like he's iconic. What are you talking about? Jay Z is an iconic rapper. I'm not saying he's the best alive. I'm saying it's surprising that no one said his name. Anyway, are we ranking those? No, no, who is your pick? Well, I mean, like, you know, I don't know. What are we talking about? Best rapper alive. No, there's different things. Like what are we talking about? Are we talking about their ability to freestyle? Are we talking about their actual produced music? They're saying we're talking about how they perform live? Are we talking about what their songs? Like what the fuck are we talking about? Totality. Give it to me. I got talking about like old guys young guy. Look, what are we talking about alive? I got I mean, dude, no of these people. I don't think I don't think a single one of these motherfuckers hit on the best rappers alive. Maybe M&M. Yeah, it is. The baby is fucking amazing. It's free style. It was great. Like Lil Wayne's up there too. I would put Lil Wayne up there. No, I'm surprised I didn't hit Lil Wayne up there. No, no. Well, like Lil Wayne, Carter Three, bro. She was fire. I don't know, man, it's a hard question because like, you know, there's just a lot in my mind. I don't think like that. I don't think in totality. I think of like, you know, lyrically, who's the best who's the best rapper? Man, I don't know. I like the baby. I like fucking I like Kendrick Lamar. I like you like Drake. Don't you know, two chains? Yeah, but he's not the best. You know, I would have said young Dolph was the best before he was killed of modern rappers. I think Dolph told real stories in a way that that I appreciate because that's the error that I come from. He had a he had an older sound. Some, you know, I grew up with, you know, Joe and I grew up around the same shit, you know, big and two pocket and big and two pocket both had storytelling ability that was beyond everybody else. And then Biggie's freestyle was the best I ever fucking seen. So I don't know. It just depends on what you're looking at. You know, you could tell a lot of these guys are just talking radio shit. Yeah, right. But then it's a hard question, you know, and like other other like like bro Buster rhymes didn't get in that fucking getting didn't get said and like brother Nobody can rap like Buster rhymes. Yeah, like that's fat. You know, like that's fast. Nobody can rap that fast and make everything work. And you know, I'm not saying he's the greatest alive, but fuck dude. He's above most of these motherfuckers. That's not true. Yeah. You know, so it's just, you know, like I don't think like as much as I like, I do like futures music. And I do like those guys stuff, you know, those guys are those guys are their reading shit and it's produced and it's a performance. It's not like real rapping. Um, so you just have to, I don't know. I tell you what, out of the newer guys like the baby, I've seen him freestyle and it is fucking incredible. He's pretty good. He's fucking crazy. I don't, I'm not seeing anybody of the younger guys or the newer guys that even talk to do that. Yeah. No, bro. And like if we're talking like what we're talking about delivery and coming from the chest, nobody comes harder and fucking ice cube. Nobody, you know what I'm saying? So I mean, there's just a lot of things to consider. I think honestly, the best rapper that I've seen ever in my whole life is big. That's my opinion. Yeah. I don't. I don't think it's a cliche answer. And I don't say that just because the records that he made, but if you've ever watched him freestyle, like just like, hey, rap about this, it's fucking insane. He goes. Yeah. Yeah. And, and he pioneered that style. We don't, we don't have rap is not that same game anymore. Now it's, you know, right, the lines of a poem and say him how you would say him. Yeah. And uh, fuck, I don't know, bro. Like there's a lot of guys I like that. I mean, dude, it's just hard. It's a hard, it's a hard debate. It's probably what makes it fun. Yeah. For sure. I mean, what do you think? Yeah, right. I got, I got, I like knives. Now I just, a, not as he gets enough. That's a real answer. I don't think he gets enough flowers, bro. I like knives. I also like fucking J. Colbe, bro. Now it's a different, that's a little different, like flow, but I like J. Coles, I think lyrically, bro, he's probably one of the top of my opinion. Bro, and like, dude, if you want to go to plus, there's innovative styles. I mean, dude, the Beastie boys did shit that nobody ever did, right? Yeah. Run DMC shit. They still live, aren't they? No, the Beastie boys were just their own thing and like it's, it's, it's just, dude, it's just a tough question. Yeah. Up until Doth was killed, I would have said young Doth is I'm to have for sure. Yeah, for sure. But I mean, dude, like it is hard to, it is hard to say that anybody's better than Buster Rhymes because of his ability to think up and rap quickly and have it tell a story and make sense. Like that's just a different fucking skill. And he's a massive patriot. Yeah, yeah. Real talk. So I, you know, I mean, fuck, dude, you can even talk about like, I mean, there's just a lot of guys that are lyrically much better than, than the guys of today that don't get any credit, like and to have their own style. Like I like guys that have their own, like you hear him and you know that that's what that is. Twisted like bro, I like mystical because dude, you hear mystical and you know exactly who the fuck it is. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Fuck, that's just a great question. So I mean, you could talk about it for hours. But the best I've seen ever in my lifetime is Biggie. I know he's not alive. The best alive. I'd probably have to say, you know, it's, there's five other guys that are all in the same conversation. Rick Ross is about to. Oh dude, Rick Ross is his own thing. Like dude, it's his own thing. I mean, that's what I like. He's breathing on the track. Yeah, but dude, it's his own thing. Like I do not like these guys that all sound alike. Yeah. Like I don't like that shit. I like guys that the minute you could fucking hear it, you're like, that's who that is. And right now, I think for the last 10 or so years, we've had this, this shit that all sounds kind of the same. And now I think a lot of the guys are becoming more recognizable. Um, and kind of finding their lanes, but we went through a period there where like it was just the same shit. Yeah, shit. Yeah. So I don't know. It's interesting. I, I mean, it could be debated for hours. Yeah. Well guys, let's go down to the comments. Yeah. Well, you guys think it was the best rapper alive. And that being said, man, guys, anything. It's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Shut the shut. Box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in the cold. Bad bitch. Bulldoch's woke. Got a own bank row. Can't fold. Doesn't know. Here's shot case. Closed.
