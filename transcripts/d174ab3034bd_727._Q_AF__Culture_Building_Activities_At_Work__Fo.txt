Yeah, they're good You know who's in the original yeah, it was Kevin Bacon and uh Got who the other was Kevin Baker. Yeah, I've seen the original one you have hmm. Hey, I'm actually impressed you see it. Yeah Yeah All right, let's go Damn do ray minutes in everybody else are turning shit off Guys, Andy question number one Andy Uh, I'm 36 and I run a team of 20 people in my business. Uh, my team has become so used uh, so used to the typical culture building activities top golf bowling dinners Axe throwing, etc. That I feel like they don't really enjoy them anymore What's the best way to completely realign an entire company and hit home the meaning of a winning culture and playing as a team? How do you do that? By winning Okay, you can have all the barbecues you want you can go play all the golf you want you can go out to all the dinners You want you can go to top golf you can hold hands you can sing kubai yah you can do all that shit, bro But nothing bonds a team like winning that is the bottom line and a lot of you guys think you're going to substitute actually winning and performing for Things that are you know like having a pizza party in the in the company kitchen and that's just not gonna do it guys Ultimately the way that people respect and love and and enjoy working together is because they struggle They overcome and then they celebrate together on the unified effort to overcome the problem with the solution So if you really want to build a good culture obviously there's a whole I could talk about this for a week straight I could do a whole week workshop, but I'm gonna summarize it in two minutes You got to win Okay, so those things that you're trying to do will take on a different meaning when you are kicking ass All right, so what do you got to do to get your team to win? How do you get them to get focused? How do you get them to all row in the same direction? How do you get them to understand what they're trying to do? You have to be very clear about what the mission is You have to be very clear about what the values are the framework So to speak about how you're going to operate to get where you want to go And then you have to be very clear about actual performance expectations and making sure that people hit them And if you can do those things you'll start to produce wins and it won't matter if you're sitting out back with a webricut I'll have some burgers or if you're in Vegas at a pool party or after you're at The Vatican or whatever you do to bond your team Traveling activities. It won't matter. It'll be awesome So winning is the key component that most people lose when they try to build a culture They try to have a mediocre company that produces mediocre results and then have amazing culture and you can't have that you can't There's not a medium Think of it in sports There is not a team that goes 500 that has an awesome culture It doesn't exist. It doesn't matter how much you do how much you train all these things that you do to try to build it or manufacture it Great culture ultimately comes from working together and then overcoming obstacles together This is why great football teams or great sports teams That bond is developed in the training. It's developed in the suffering It's developed in the two days or the hard practices where everybody else isn't out there and it's a hundred degrees and you're sweating your ass off And then you start to win because of those actions that you did collectively those are the things that actually produce great culture and so I feel like a lot of companies try to Band-aid that lack of winning with a positive culture and you have to understand it doesn't work You're never going to have a team that's losing you're never going to have a team that's 500 You're never even going to have a team that's okay like pretty good. There has a great culture great culture Legitimately comes from winning and then you can refine it you can Direct it you can bring it in so that it self replicates and becomes The actual feeling of the business right just like when you walk into your favorite restaurant and you get a feeling There's a reason you go there because it feels a certain way and a lot of you guys once you're company to feel that way But you can't do that unless you actually Teach your people how to win first and and that requires a direction that requires a framework And then you know you start to harness it in and direct it whether you need it to go over the course of time and it becomes a living breathing Actual organism that doesn't necessarily need you to Think about it all the time because the team what do you say had 80? 30 20 20 20 that's enough people for it to regulate itself So like when a new person comes in okay those people Will will will make sure that the new person fits the culture and if they don't fit the culture that we don't know so This is what we do in arte guys like if you wanted to join arte syndicate.com That's what Ed and I do we teach these kind of things in depth um We put on a number of workshops throughout the year to really teach these things in depth But ultimately guys good culture comes from winning It doesn't come from a sign you hang in the locker room It doesn't come from some values you put on the wall that you don't live by you don't communicate by you don't hire by you don't fire by And that's what people think culture is culture people think that culture is an accident Which is a big mistake and then they also think that it's Just as simple as defining a mission statement and some core values and like making some cool signs that they go in the wall That say shit like integrity, right like What is it what the fuck does that even mean and they don't coach on it. They don't talk about it They don't relate it to people and it becomes just a sign, you know How many of you guys played a high school sports where they had some sticker on the wall that said You know effort right what the fuck does that mean right and so there's a lot to this when it comes to creating a great business culture Uh, but ultimately it's gonna come from the small wins and then you build upon that and just trying to take them to top Golf or this or that that's not gonna get it done bro. You need to you need to have some wins to start building on it Yeah, I love that man. I think also two men another thing is like And correct me if I'm on here, but I feel like a lot of people always typically see the end result of what somebody else is doing Right and they copy that thinking that's gonna get them there sure when the reality was a lot of work. There was a process for that right Yeah, I mean, that's true bro, you know It takes years and years and years to build a strong culture in an organization Whether that be a football team baseball team a church a company it doesn't matter the organizations are all the same You're taking a big group of people and you're getting them a line and you're getting them to move a certain direction and That takes time because you can't do that in a day you can't do it in a week and you can't do it without resistance The minute you start to try to redefine what your culture is and you try to redefine That you're gonna lose people This is why like when teams do rebuilding they fucking get rid of everybody every I'm gonna get rid of all the coaches They get rid of all the players that are any good and they say fuck it. We're starting over Because the culture needs to be built from the bottom up and a lot of people don't want to put the effort in They don't want to put the time in they don't know how to they think that culture building You know a lot of people look at Bill Bellachek right or Nick Saban and they think like fuck dude He just gets all the players so like he's just great. No dude. That's these guys are masters at what I'm talking about Okay, they know how to do this from the ground up And they know how to do it with any kind of player by the way St. Louis Cardinals a great organization to talk about culture All right, they're here in St. Louis. Well, we're from you know We don't we very rarely go out and sign big stars all of our players come from the bottom and worked Their way up through the farm system and become stars and then we win with those you know St. Louis is one of the winningest teams in all of baseball history And we come from one of the smallest markets and it's because the culture is so strong And it actually permeates out from the team into the fan base And that's the part where a lot of you guys want because you look at companies to have fanatical fan bases But you don't even have fanatical employees So how the fuck are you gonna have fanatical fan base without fanatical employees? You can't and you think that solvent is gonna be like oh, we got a cake for Karen's birthday Hey, that's what guys we got Karen's birthday today enough and then we got a cake like that's not culture either Okay, motherfuckers want to win. They want to kick ass. They want to beat people's ass human beings are competitive dude They're not Dysyle average fat little slabs by Default but we're fucking warriors, bro And we want to win and when you unlock someone's potential to want to win by showing them what a win feels like it changes everything in them so Decide where you're going Develop a mission statement develop some values that create the framework We are going to move forward within this framework. We are not going to do unethical things We are going to show all the things you want your company to represent Define those things Start moving forward and make sure that you're winning and when you start to win they won't matter what culture building things You do you can't bandaid this it's it's Honestly, dude real talk you if you're interested in doing this you need to join our team That's the truth because we talk about this. It's it's literally The entire foundation of what we talk about of how to build a company. Well, we're not in there. This isn't personal coaching. This isn't You know fucking kumbaya. I'm not going to get in there and show you how to build a fucking funnel or do any Ecom shit. That's now we do. I trust that you know how to do some of that stuff What we do is we teach you how to build a fucking company Okay, so for those of you that want to build a company and you want to build a solid company that makes a difference and makes a Fuck ton of money and kicks everybody's ass Rates the place to go and there's nobody else out there that can teach it because none of these other motherfuckers have done that Go fucking love it man guys any question number two Any I'm 33 years old my question is very simple How do you forgive yourself for a mistake you made in the past When I was 22 years old. I made a really bad decision I mean, I have paid the price and accepted the consequences But here I am 11 years later and while I made Write my wrongs. I'm still paying for it. How does one truly forgive themselves? Well look that's I think that's a hard thing especially for a highly driven person Because if you're in ambitious, I'm assuming that you are a driven ambitious person or you probably wouldn't listen to the show When you're a highly driven ambitious person you hold high standards for yourself and the people around you and because you hold such high standards for the people around you You inadvertently usually hold even higher standards for yourself. So this is a common problem with people Who are leaders who are People who understand the weight of leadership that they have And when they make mistakes, it's usually pretty hard for them to let it go but what I've learned Is a couple things one Being a leader that never makes mistakes or being a human that never makes mistakes is not admirable in any way shape or form Your power is in the lessons that you've learned from the mistakes that you've made And if you've made some big mistakes that means you've got some big fucking power And you understand some big lessons about life that a lot of people don't So what I would make you understand is that you need to lean into that and start sharing those lessons that you've learned with other people so that they understand What you've learned without having to go through the process. That's the first thing The second thing is is when you do that people respect you more people respect people who are honest about who they are and transparent about who they are Whether it's good or whether it's bad You know, there's a lot of people on the internet that want to pretend like they're infallible and they're perfect and they're That and those people get attacked hard core because everybody knows that none of us are perfect This is why I come on the show all the time and I tell you guys Bro, I'm the farthest thing from perfect I have literally made every single fucking mistake in my life that you could possibly fucking make okay So I understand what it's like to like and it's probably why you guys listen to me because I made all those fucking mistakes And I know a lot of answers all right So don't shy away from being just honest with yourself like hey, yeah, I fucked up Bro, but here's what I learned and I can help other people with that then as I was saying the second part is is that when you are Transparent and you are a human being people respect you more they say okay, that just been through some shit. He owned it I can learn from him. I respect that he's working through it and it makes people feel better about you not worse I think people have an underlying fear where they think like if they find out this thing about me They're gonna think I'm a piece of shit Maybe but probably only if you lie about it if you actually told the truth is say yeah man. I made a terrible decision um, I was a different person then yeah, and you you just kind of say what I think people really identify with that because do we're all that all of us are that These social media people that pretend like they're perfect. They're lying dude. This is a lie all of those people have a I actually believe the people who have the most polished image on the internet are the people with the most skeletons in their fucking closet Okay, so when you look at these people and they make you feel bad because they seem like they've never made a mistake Like these pastors and shit online who try to like make it you know what it's the way a couple of years and look at the headlines We'll come back after that right and dude listen It's just not true ever the the human Experience involves bad decision making and Then dealing with the consequences of those decisions. There's not a human being that's ever lived in the entire history of earth that has ever got around that okay Besides Jesus, okay, let's be real so When we think about like What we're looking at and what we're comparing to remember that when you're comparing yourself to a bunch of people that appear to be perfect They have just as many things in their past as you do that they're just not talking about because they're afraid like I said in the first part That people are gonna find out and judge them harshly and they're refusing to step into their obligation to teach people The lessons that they've learned from making those hard mistakes because they're embarrassed all right I don't think there's a lot of nobility in that so With all that being said how do you forgive yourself and that's a hard thing man because like I Have struggled with this myself because I anybody that's around me knows that I hold very high standards for everybody around me And so when I when I don't hold those standards I'm ten times harder on myself than I am on anybody around me I think we all are if we have integrity and we are driven human beings that have high expectations so What I've come to understand about forgiving yourself uh Aside from all the things I just mentioned is like You have to kind of think of it like you would think of it if you're friend did it okay, so like whatever it is you did Let's just imagine that you didn't do it, but you're best friend in it okay and your best friend comes to you and they say Hey, man, I fucked this up dude. I did this thing 11 years ago. I still feel bad about it. I feel guilty about it Is really messing with my head? What do you think okay, and what would you say to that person and I think what most people would say is they would say hey look Dude that's life shit happens. You made a bad choice. You've improved yourself. You're a different person now We got to use those lessons and we got to keep moving down the path And that's what you would say to that person if that person were your friend I think I think most people would say something like that if it was really bad They say well that's really bad bro. You shouldn't do that Let's make sure that doesn't happen again. That's what a good friend would say right And so you have sometimes you got to be a good friend to yourself and you got to treat yourself as you would treat your friend So that's how I deal with those things you know like the things I've done in my past that I'm not proud of you know, I I Until probably the last three or four years I carried that shit and then I realized well hold on dude Everybody else has a bunch of fuck-ups too what the fuck you know and then I started realizing well How do I get over that? What would I say to to my brother if he said that to me or what would I say to Chris or what would I say to DJ if they came Well, I would say hey, you're a dumbass. Why the fuck you do that don't do that again, right? You know, I'm saying What you learning from it? Yeah, right and so we have to talk to ourselves As if we're talking to our best friend and instead of just beating ourselves in a nothing over these mistakes And I found that to be the best way to actually forgive yourself, you know And obviously, you know, whatever it is that you're holding you know part of the forgiveness process is if possible is trying to make that right But outside of that man, you got to chalk it up to a lesson and keep moving forward. That's that's what life's about What makes me think too, man? Like what's the other option you're gonna go another 11 years and we're gonna go next 30 years Right because you did one thing right. I mean look man. There's things to happen. You know bad things happen Um Things Look man, I just I don't know. I just think that that's part of the life experience You know, no you can't carry that shit through your life and let it bury you. You would you want that for your friend? Right. No. Yeah, right. Right. Right. So why would you do that to yourself? That doesn't make sense Sometimes you got to be your own best friend. I love it. I love it. Uh guys Andy uh third and final question Andy I'm 17 years old I know it's gonna take some time But I want to have a shit ton of money. Yeah. What would you say is the number one skill that pays the bills I want to be able to do anything I want help my family set my future kids up Um, and also what's more practical do you get one of your tools in my tool belt really sharp then move on to the next one Or do I level each skill skill and tool than my belt at the same time like do I focus on building one up And then focus on the next I just feel that personal development can be a little overwhelming sometimes trying to figure out where to go first The reason it's overwhelming for you is because you're trying to create the perfect product before you go That's not how it works. You have to go and then along the way you acquire the skills All right, so a lot of people and I'll get to the meat of this question here in just a second But I want you to understand this a lot of people Think they can just read and consume and go to seminars and they're gonna develop all these skills And then they're gonna go and it's just gonna work That's not how the fuck it works You could go to seminars you can read you can join coaches and things like that But all they're gonna do is give you the direction there's still the work you have to do it's no different than being on a diet I could tell you what the fuck to do, but unless you go do it it doesn't matter it doesn't work so Understand that it's go then learn not learn then go all right, that's where people most people never even get past that Um in terms of what the skills are and how you develop them there is basically three main skills that will take you from a place of No money to a place of however much money you want to get depending on how far you want to take it and those three skills are sales management slash leadership of people And the third one is being able to take initiative for a project and see it through from beginning to end Without anybody else's help, okay? Most people can't do any of those and they want some gigantic paycheck For showing up to work or starting a company like we talked about on last Q&A Where you know people think they just start a company and they're they're entitled to some sort of high-level lifestyle or because they show up to work They're entitled to some high-level paying position. No, you have to trade your value for the money That's how it fucking goes. So When we think about these three skills sales management leadership and then Initiative to see a product project from beginning to end these are the three rarest skills in any company, okay? So one Sales how do you learn to sell by putting yourself in a position where you have to sell over and over and over again and a great way to do this By the way, this is not an e-com funnel. This is not through the internet. This is not drop shipping I'm legitimately talking about putting yourself in like retail environment or an environment where you have to talk to people to learn to sell The reason why you can't just do this through e-commerce because the principles that apply to creating ads that work You will actually learn face to face Through these reps, okay? So if you want to learn sales the fastest way possible You need to put yourself in a position where you are talking to people and selling them either on the phone or in person many many times a day 30 40 50 times a day Okay, that will sharpen your scale your sales skill set As quickly as you possibly can management leadership that will come after you've become successful at selling because If you're a great salesman eventually you will be asked to train other salesmen You will be asked to lead or organize other salesmen which by the way Just because you can sell doesn't mean you can manage salesmen all right It's a totally different skill set and you need to fucking understand that so once you're great at selling You're going to be asked hey here's five sales people I want you to run this team now you have to learn how to lead and manage That's a whole different skill set and guess how you're going to do that the same way you learn the first one reps Over and over and over and over and over again making mistakes learning consuming all the information Following great leadership reading great leadership books like Vince Lombardi books or John Wooden books or anything the Jaco has written these are amazing leadership resources That will help you Quick in the process, but won't do the process for you you still have to go do it um And then after that the the third skill was sort of materialized because you have developed the two main skills Which are sales and marketing and leadership and then along the way There'll be a number of projects that you have to come up with and then develop and put out as a finished product right whether that be a new system of operations An SOP or some sort of procedure or whatever You're going to say okay, we have a we have a problem here or it could be a product We could make a product here because it could be in sales right this product would sell here's how we develop it all the way I developed this product I'm selling and look at this that's what entrepreneurs ship about if you're an injured Renewer that might be inside of a business. Hey, I think this would work you Build the product build the solution take the presentation to your higher ups and say look this will work This is how I did it I did it for my dear to finish concept all we got to do is write the chest I'm gonna go sell them fuck ton of this shit. That's those people are valuable dude like they're infinitely valuable If you can learn these three skill sets You can write your fucking paycheck Legitimately because if your company won't fucking pay it and you actually have those skills like you truly have those skills I'm not talking about all you motherfuckers that think you're great at what the fuck you do yet You don't have any dollars in your bank account Okay, how can you be great at what you do if you don't have any dollars in your bank account? That is a misunderstanding of Your value which is a lot of people have a lot of people believe they're way more valuable than they are When the reality of their value tells them the story they just refuse to look at it They don't look at their house. They don't look at their cars They don't look at the money they're making and they think well, I'm getting fucked No, you're not good enough bro. You are not skilled enough because if you were Your company might not pay you but somebody else's will Okay, so once you start to understand the true value of your skill set And you're producing results Bro, you walk in the bosses office and say Hey, bro, uh I'm the best of this and the best of this and the best of this I did this I did this I did this I built this person I developed these people I saw this project through and nobody else in here doing this shit I'm worth this And and I love you, but if you don't pay me that I'm a fucking goal over here Okay, and that's how you do it you got to you got to hold your fucking boss hostage like and I hate to say that because I'm fucking boss right but no the truth is If I had a mother fucker that come to me it has all those skill sets he says hey This I'm gonna say Because like I don't want to take the time to develop that person all over again See what I'm saying that's years and years and years and years so but but dude going back to last Q&A If you haven't listened to last Q&A if we cover this a lot of people believe That they are much better than they really are okay, and you're dude you have to be able to observe the objective reality of where you are It's not like if your friends and family are gassing you up and telling you you're great. Guess what? That don't be shit Okay, if your co-workers are telling you how great you are that don't be shit All right, Joe if you're producing some music and everybody in the building says that it's great Does that mean anything? No, it doesn't mean anything because they're biased. They love Joe What really matters is what the fucking market says does the market say do people that don't know you say you're good Do people that have no idea who you are look at your work and say fuck bro? That's amazing That's where you start to know that if you're actually good and a lot of you guys just lacked the ability because you've grown up in an Taddle society where everybody gets a trophy everybody's You know talk that they are special and great, and it's just not true You're not great. You're not special. You got to earn it like everybody else and that's not a dig at you But if you go through your life thinking that you're gonna be entitled to get shit for not being very good You're gonna be unsuccessful and I'm not doing you any favor by blowing smoke up your ass about that like bro You're not good enough if you were good enough. You'd be getting fucking paid. Yeah, so those are the three skills sales Management slash leadership which there's in there's nuances to both They're not the same thing, but they're close enough to be put together and then the ability to see a Project from beginning to end that will either help your company or the company that you're a part of and there's probably a force skill There too, which I would consider like a second level skill under the leadership management part If you have the ability to replicate yourself By leading other people and coaching them. So let's say you develop this amazing skill set for sales You're a pretty good leader and you don't understand how to take initiative and finish projects And then you're able to train other people to do that and you have all three of those skills bro You're fucking untouchable. You'll run everybody else to fuck over. Yeah, I love let me actually this and because I think I think You know you mentioned this whole you know you got to learn People think they have to learn and then go when reality is go you learn. Yeah Now when we talk about you know along this road these skills that come up these mistakes She'll make that you'll learn from and all these things right Is that probably I feel like the biggest thing here that we got to we got to hit on it What I'm trying to hit on is the awareness being aware of these are actual skills coming my way these are actual Lessons from these mistakes I can learn Versus you know where you are now versus 20 years ago 25 years ago How what what's what's the difference look like as far as actually sharpening these skills that you have versus acquiring them in the first The biggest difference between where I was when I was 19 and where I'm at at 44 Um was that in 19 2021-22 probably first 10 years. I was in business if I made a mistake. I dwelled on the mistake for a period of time Before I was willing to accept what it taught me all right So I wasted a lot of time collectively because you make a lot of mistakes in your first 10 years of business Did you start? Okay, so you so listen think about it like this just think about it in math terms You make a mistake in year one you spend two weeks down about it and then you learn a lesson Then you make another mistake right after that then you spend two weeks down about it Then you accept the lesson all right and you add up all those two weeks over the course of 10 years And you're talking about a massive amount of time that could have been saved Has you just accepted the lesson right away and not dwelled on it? We have to understand that The the quicker that we can get over it and accept the lesson the more time we have to move forward the quicker we will get where we want to go Does that make sense makes perfect sense man Okay, so that's the biggest difference between younger entrepreneurs and older entrepreneurs And by the way if you're a young entrepreneur and you actually listen to what I'm telling you You can learn to do that right now and you could save yourself a shit ton of time It took me fucking 20 years to figure that out It took me legit 10 years to really figure it out It took me another five to fucking like master it That's what I feel like it's an awareness thing man like like being aware that hey this is not bad This is good in this like I can use this man. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fucking awesome. Yeah. I think it's awesome I love it guys Eddie that was three. Yep. All right. Let's get out there kick ass this week guys. Don't be a hoe show the show You
