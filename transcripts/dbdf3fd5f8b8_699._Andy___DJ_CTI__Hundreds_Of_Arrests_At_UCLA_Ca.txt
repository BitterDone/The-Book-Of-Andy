That's good word for it. Yeah. Robust. Yeah. Robust pinky's up, guys. Yeah. Headline number one. Now, this is an interesting dive into this. And of course, we got some anti-domus action in this headline coming here in a couple of minutes. So stay tuned. Let's dive into this. Headline number one reads, update hundreds of arrests as riot police clear UCLA's Gaza camp, at least one officer injured. Now, these protests, they're heating up all over the country, right? All of these Ivy League schools, there's massive protests. We had one here at Wash You the other day. There was like 150 people locked up. You know, and things are heating up. Okay. Now, police, this headline, this article reads, please move in on the UCLA campus early Thursday morning. It made hundreds of arrests to clear the Gaza camp protests. This occurred after authorities warned that the encampment was, quote, unlawful, in quote, that everyone must leave the area. Now, here's a video clip from those arrests. Um, clip is here. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. It just, I mean, it just, it looks crazy. Now, we, we know these serial typical, you know, activists, nerds. We've seen them. Yeah. They're out there with their fucking trash can lids and their fucking pool noodles. So they upgraded though. They are. I know. I see they all got the same tents and the same equipment now. They, they've upgraded. Have you seen this clip of this fucking? Oh, they got umbrellas now. Well, no, what they did is you know, those like 55 gallon yard waste trash cans. Yeah. They cut them in half and you shield. That's the shield. Bro, I want you to see this clip because this dude gets fucking hammered. Watch this. Look at him. Woo, yeah, go guys. Woo. Fuck fascism. Full speed. That's the top speed for those guys right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. You got to learn today. Bro. Bro, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This long ass run to do that. He gets fucking level. And the cop barely pushed him. Too much anime. Too much anime, man. Too many hot pockets. Bro, beat that kid's ass. Pull out that nice stick and beat the shit out of that kid. Police brutality. Bring it back. Bro, he sneezed on the dude, bro. Listen. These guys are frail and we, bro, pride. Most of them are fucking vegan. Yeah. Okay. That's the crazy thing, man, because I remember the freshman 15. Like, I feel like you. 15, huh? Yeah, it was a little bit more 15. But like, bro, like, I mean, that was like a thing now. And I feel like now these freshmen, they're like losing it. Huh? They're not gaining anything. Motherfucker, these guys ain't the same as you. Yeah. Most sure. These are little nerds that play dungeon and drags in their fucking basement, bro. They, they, you notice how white they are? They're here. We see the sun. Bro, these guys are lucky. They're not like a fire from the fucking sun hitting their skin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna say, bro, look at them. I'm gonna say my commentary to the end. I got a lot to say about these fuckers. I hope they bring that shit to me, bro. Yeah. I really do. Please you nerd show up. Where I'm at. I'm at. Please. I'm gonna have my auntie for acts. We're gonna go to fucking work. Let's go to work, man. But yeah, these protests, now listen, now, I mean, when they're advocating for what they're quote unquote protesting for, you know, you guys can have your own opinion on that. I'm a firm believer in the constitution of this country. First amendment's there for a reason, right? Everybody has the right to peacefully protest and assemble that's in our God given rights as citizens here. And I also believe equally in the second amendment, which is there if people fuck with the first, right? And so like, I'm all for it. Now there is a line. There is something that is happening right now in this country that is kind of shifting the dynamics and narratives that are going on right now. And it is dangerous to our democracy. And I think it's important that we call it out. Have you guys seen this? This headline reads, House passes bill to expand definition of anti-Semitism amid growing campus protest over Gaza war. Right now, like I feel like on the surface, it's, you know, all right, you know, anti-Semitism, people could have their own arguments about it. They could believe it's bad and dangerous. Sure, that's up to you. But to go into a specific legislation for our lawmakers who are in office to represent us, the American people, this takes us a whole step further because it has nothing to do with Jewish Americans. That's the danger of it. So let's dive into this a little bit. House passed legislation Wednesday that would establish a broader definition of anti-Semitism for the Department of Education to enforce anti-discrimination laws. The latest response from lawmakers to a nationwide student protest movement over the Israel-Hamas war. The proposal, which passed 320 to 91 with some bipartisan support would codify the international Holocaust remembrance alliances definition of anti-Semitism. Very, very important to stop here and recognize that the international Holocaust remembrance alliance is not a United States organization. No, it is a foreign organization. Right. So understand that. Right, keep going. This is not just a normal in just a row. This isn't American saying this. This is we are making a law based upon some other countries' opinions about what our law should be. Right. And it literally verbatim copies their definition of it, which is fluid. They can decide. They can change the definition anytime. At any time. Because the way the law's written, it says we're using this person's, the international Holocaust remembrance alliances, definition. So we aren't in the law. We are not clearly defining what. First of all, hate speech is free speech. And if people don't fucking like it, that's fine. But the truth of the matter is, is that wouldn't you rather hear the hate speech and then make them look stupid and let them make themselves look stupid? You're on hate speech? Yeah, bro, no, it's not to your own hate speech. It's when dumbasses expose themselves, that's on them. They have to live with the consequences of that. So to say that someone can't say, hate, well, so now we can't find out who the fucking actual people are that are shitbags. Right. You see what I'm saying? Right. Like, bro, if something is hate, it should be easily opposed and discredited. Right. You understand? Like, if I already deals with that on the thought. That's right. They say, this guy's a fucking big, a fucked-up guy. Yeah, a real big, a real big, like the real stuff. 100% man. Now, Matt Walsh, who I am actually a personal fan of, I like this guy. I actually got to talk to him. I got to go see him when he came here to slu and, get in a bunch of little nerd show up. Yeah, it was cool. Yeah, it was cool. But so he's covered this a little bit. He put out a tweet saying, quote, the vast majority of Republicans just voted for a bill to criminalize criticisms of the Israeli government. That is what this bill is about. Yes. Okay. So, if a bill passes, you will be guilty of hate speech. If you quote, apply double standards to the government of Israel or accuse it of genocide. This is honestly one of the most insane pieces of legislation I've ever seen. Now, here are four points inside of this bill that I think are important to show. The first one. Denying the Jewish people, they're right, to self-determination, examples given, by claiming the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor. So you say that straight to jail. Okay. Applying double standards by requiring of it, a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. So basically holding Israel accountable to their actions, the Israeli government holding them accountable to their actions, and not anybody else that are committed, like that straight to jail. Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism, examples given claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel to characterize Israel or Israeli. So, Jews did kill Jesus. If you address any truths or facts, historical facts or things that have long been considered as historical facts, straight to jail, straight to jail. And the last one I thought that was interesting. Drawing, this is really interesting. Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policies to get that of the Nazis. Now, our good buddy, Matt Kim, who makes great content, you find or you find. He's coming on show. Oh, that's fucking great. Yeah, we gotta come out. I like his outlook on things. He posted a video also. You know what I like about his stuff? Is it, it's unemotional? Oh, it's completely unemotional. It's just very much what it is. He does such a great job. That was a great job, man. And so he posted a clip about this topic. Let's see what he has to say. The House just voted on HR 690, the anti-Semitism Awareness Act. 320 to 91. I told you, free speech is at risk. Christianity is at risk. They're coming for your freedom and values. They're attempting to pass a federal law making a legal to criticize Israel and utilizing the definition of anti-Semitism by a group called International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. Who is this group? Long story short, it's not American. Why are non-American organizations defining our words and laws? Under this new bill, the federal government can sue, prosecute, or sanction more people, businesses, and universities for supposed violations of civil rights law. I'm not advocating for anti-Semitism or hate at all. But I do know that freedom of speech is at risk. And freedom of speech means that we need to live with words or ideas we don't agree with. Here are listed things that would be considered legal. This bill passed to the Senate and gets signed into law. Saying Ben Shapiro loves Israel more than America, a legal saying Jewish people responsible for their crucification of Jesus, a legal saying Jewish people control the media economy and government, a legal saying October 7th, what is inside job, a legal being a Holocaust liar, of course, a legal saying George Soros is trying to create chaos and are sure in a new world order, a legal. You may or may not agree with any of these statements. That's not the point. The issues, opinions, and beliefs are yours and yours alone. You are allowed to hold them regardless of what the government tells you to believe. Free speech is a cornerstone of our society. First, they take your words, then they take your ideas and ability to communicate. Next, we're nothing but slaves serving their dystopian oligarchy. So that's Matt Kims, who I thought covered that beautifully. And now let's go check in with Israel and the people of Israel. This is coming from the Jerusalem post. This headline reads, over half of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign immediately. Over half 58% of the Israeli public believes that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should resign immediately, including 28% of those who voted for the block that supports Netanyahu. According to a poll published by N12 on Tuesday. Additionally, 48% of Israelis believe the Defense Minister Yves Goulant should resign immediately. 50% believe IDF chief of staff, hersy Halivai should resign immediately. And 56% believe Shinbet had Ronan Barr should resign now. What does that say? Anyone got on that? Well, first of all, look at what they're trying to do. Well, let's go back to the riot things, right? I do find it in, I do believe I agree with you. That freedom of assembly and protest should be allowed. I personally think it's funny what's happening because these are the same people who did BLM. And the reason that they're doing what they're doing now is because during BLM, they got away with it. They fucking did whatever they want. They didn't get arrested. And there is a hypocrisy in that in itself. So it's okay for people to protest black people and what's going on with George Floyd, who was a fucking criminal, who got, and it's okay for black people to burn down their own neighborhoods, but you criticize Israel. You criticize Jewish people, quote unquote, now all of a sudden they're removing any arrest in them right away. Well, Andy, hold on, what do you mean by that? It's almost like you're saying there's a double standard here with what's allowed to be criticized in society. It's almost, you know, like it's interesting, you say that because Biden just comes out and condemns all of the protests going on. Saying, quote, the order must prevail. Why didn't they do this during BLM? It's funny you say that, Andy, what did they do during BLM? Oh, I got a headline here from 2020, Biden opened his statement on this stuff by saying, quote, I can't breathe, I can't breathe. George Floyd's last words, but they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. They're echoing across the nation. Or when he said that, when he said that and they speak to a nation where every day millions of people are out of the moment of losing their lives, but in the course of living their lives are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. And even on the anniversary, our administration, this current administration continue to push the allowance of this, citing that, you know, everything is okay. It was the summer of protests that we haven't seen since the civil rights errors and the CISD protests that peacefully unified people, peacefully unified people. Absolutely not. Peacefully unified people. Do you not remember? Do you not remember Nancy Pelosi saying, people are gonna do what people are gonna do? This is gonna do it. Do you not remember Kamala Harris, like literally, and by the way, what was the other lady's name, Maxine Waters? Oh, that bitch. Telling people to fucking confront people. Getting their faces. Getting their faces. Blah, blah, blah, right? And then we have these people on television, on interviews saying, burn it to fuck down, like bro, and they didn't do shit. No, and like I'll be honest, like, I mean, if you just look at these two pictures real quick, bro, they look the same. I mean, I think the George Floyd shit was 10 times worse. Oh, yeah, bro, no, I'm saying like the same kind of thing. It's the same people. It is. There's a big difference here of what I do. Did you see that a bunch of the people that were arrested, they weren't even students of the university? They protestors. By the way, they're paid protesters. And guess who they were? Guess who your old boy Andy told you what he tell you. Oh, I believe he told you, wait until the riots start between the migrants and the citizens. So now the migrants are being paid to go protest. God, dude, why can I see this shit and no one else can fucking see it? Okay. So there's that. All right. And we got a bunch of young little kids that don't know what the fuck they're doing. Screamin' and hollering and poutin' and doin' the same shit. Runnin' around with trash canlets. They have no sense of reality. And to be completely honest, they deserve to get their asses kicked. All right. That's the truth. They deserved it in 2022. All right. Not in 2022 in 2020 also. Yeah. All right. I'll see what you do there. Yeah. I knew that might be confusing for some people. But the point is, is that it should have happened then and it didn't. And now we see that the cops actually have the potential to go do their job. Hey, motherfuckers, do your jobs. Or do they even just comparing that to J6, bro? Do your jobs with the criminals too. What, like what is allowed? But like, yeah, that's right. That's allowed, but then who's allowing it? That's right. Can't criticize. So what's the point of it? And then that article on the Jerusalem post shows that the Jewish people don't support the Jews. OK, so all you fucking idiots out here keep saying it's the Jews making blanket statements about an entire fucking group of people. When in reality, it's no different than Biden and us. We fucking hate this guy. Most of America hates this guy. Most of the Jewish people hate their guy. It's doing all this shit. Oh, and by the way, here we are with our fucking government. See, dude, what this really is? This is pandering, OK? In 2020, they painted a black people. Now they're pandering the Jews who fund their fucking campaigns. That's what they're pandering to. All right. And now you have all these people in the United States government who are willing to pass this anti-free speech legislation based upon quote unquote hate speech. When in reality, it's to make it impossible for us to speak publicly about what's actually going on. Like Matt Kim said, you can't criticize Klaus Schwab. You can't criticize George Soros. You can't criticize Israel. You can't say they take it too far. You can't say they're committing genocide when they fucking are, OK? And by the way, we shouldn't be involved in any of that. I don't give a fuck. All right, real talk. You guys fucking say, oh, you pick a motherfucker. I'm on America side. That's what I care about. I care about our country. I care about our money staying here. I care about our citizens. When our citizens are all taken care of, and our cities look fucking amazing, then we can talk about dealing with the rest of the country or the rest of the world. We cannot do that right now. All right. And that's what I'm about. I am pro-America. I am everybody else. Not second, like 10th. I don't give a fuck. The first 10 spaces, America. After that, and after we're good, and our cities look like they should. Our streets look like they should. We have no crime. We have prosperity. Things are going well. Then we can turn our focus to maybe helping some other people. But right now, no. And we are intentionally being led too thin so that it makes us vulnerable for collapse, OK? Or conquering. That's what's going on. So this legislation is bullshit. And anybody who speaks out about it, and then you guys say they're anti-Semitic, that's bullshit too. We're sitting here saying the Jewish people don't even agree with what everybody calls the Jews. And like I've been saying, for years and years and years, it is a small group of people who happen to be Jewish, who are committing amazing fucking collaborations. They're very smart. They're a gang. And they are running shit. And by the way, they're hiding behind all the good Jewish people that really have no idea and do not agree with their own government by statistical reality that we're looking at right here. OK, so what do we have then? We have rogue people at the top in our government, and all the governments in the world, making decisions that are harmful to the people, the citizens of the world. And we, the citizens of the world, need to start standing up against this shit. And anybody who votes for that, anybody who voted for that limitation, that what we're talking about here. Yeah, the 300 and some odd people that voted to pass. They all need to be out of the government. All of them. All of them. All of them. Whoever voted for that, they got to be gone. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think two men to add on to this point, if you guys need a clearer understanding or a clearer connection of the dots, right? That this is not an intentional push to weaken the country, both financially, morally, physically, right? It's very, very simple because when you take a step back and you look at the fact, OK, we're sending billions of dollars to this country to help them protect themselves from this attack that they incurred. But then when you go back to 2021, and you look at the Afghan withdrawal and the weapons that we left over there, and then you look at the $6 billion every cent I ran. And then you see how that stuff fumbles down and goes to the opponent of the so-called country we're supposed to be supporting. And you look at the fact that we're supporting, wait, so we're supporting this side and this side? Yeah, why would we do that? And at the same time, we are taxpayer dollars in the amount of billions that's going to both sides. To continue, it doesn't make sense. No, it makes perfect sense. It makes sense for them. Makes perfect sense. And I'm sorry, yes, Joe Biden's an idiot. But these 320 people that are supporting this shit, they're not that dumb, they're evil. And you can't tell me that a reasonable person with basic common sense could not understand the implications of how that would work. You can't tell me none of them knew that money or those weapons that we left in Afghanistan would end up in the hands of Hamas terrorists in Palestine. You can't tell me they didn't see that coming. You can't tell me that they didn't think that the $6 billion we sent to an enemy state. We could funnel. Right back in. You can't tell me that they're not. They fucking doing on purpose. It's intentional, man. Yeah. And this comes into why there's a, dude, this is much bigger than people realize. Why is there a war for every generation of men? Why? Because they want to call the strongest, most patriotic men by lying to them about going over and saving freedom and democracy and getting a bunch of them killed because they know those are the most hardcore patriotic, testosterone-filled males, and they don't want those people to live on because eventually those people notice what the fuck is going on here and they have a revolution. So that's why there's a war every generation of men for almost everybody, okay? Yep. And, dude, when we look at this, you know, just like I said, you know, like with the LGBTQ movement, right? Get straight up regular gay people who just want to be left alone, have to speak up against the trans shit or they're gonna get lumped in with it, right? The, not the trans, I'm minding my own business shit, but the drag queen indoctrination of kids' children, you know, we're here, we're queer, we're coming for your children, bullshit, that they all chant. Regular gay people have had to stand up against that and because they've stood up against that, they have not been grouped in with that, okay? Gays against groomers, all these people have done a really good job of saying, hey, we ain't with that shit, right? Regular Jewish people that are just regular Jewish people who are not with this shit, have to get vocal about what's going on here because there are people out here on, you know, across the spectrum who are saying, it's the Jews and that means them and it's not them. And that's very dangerous, that's how genocidal shit happens. So we need to understand, but as I've said, a gazillion times, there are bad people and there are good people and there are bad people and good people in every single culture in the world. It's been going on for 12,000 years. So for us to say or be get behind people that just keep saying, it's the Jews is not accurate because even the Jews aren't for the Jews. You see what I'm saying? When 58% of Jewish population of Israel is saying, hey, fuck this guy, how can you say they're with that? All right, so those people, that 58%, which over here it's like 70%, they gotta speak up and they gotta say, hey, we ain't with that shit, man. You see what I'm saying? And there is a bunch of Jews that are showing up at these protests and saying, hey, we're not with this shit. You know, we're starting, it's starting. Yeah, it's starting. But that has to be, if we want this shit to fully be exposed and we want these criminals to fully be standing there, we're no close and we can clearly see what's going on. The regular Jewish people, like we all know a bunch of them, they're all regular people, they're cool as fuck, they're either doing their thing, they gotta stand up and say, hey, fuck that shit. You know what I'm saying? Because it's easier to hide behind 14 million or whatever it is. That's what they're doing. That's exactly what we're doing. And it's easy to hide. It's easy to get lost in the sauce there. You know, but fuck, you call them 10 out of them, 10 of them by name. That's right. That's right. By name, who are the fucking people doing this? Who are the actual human beings doing this? Forget the fact that they're Jewish or black or white or fucking anything else. Who are the motherfuckers doing this? Oh, it's Klaus Schwab. It's Soros. It's Natanyahu. So it's fucking 20 other motherfuckers, 100 other motherfuckers. It's Biden. You know what I'm saying? You call them out. Call the make the list of the people doing it and stop generalizing entire fucking groups of people. That's not right. It's not accurate either. No. No, no. I mean, find a little thing on this too. I think out of all of this, there is some light in here. Biden is doing some good things. He's uniting America. I mean, he got both pro-Mass protesters and Trump supporters to both unanimously, collectively chant, fuck Joe Biden. I thought it was going to be clear. Move signs. Does unity, bro? Well, listen, this is a whole nother dynamic. Okay? The Democrats have really fucked up here. Oh, yeah. Because they put themselves in a corner that they can't fucking talk their way out of. Because Biden will not fucking speak against Israel because that's where all the funding for their fucking party comes from. Okay? Plus their strategic alliances, plus their information they get from the side. Plus all the blackmail Mossad has on Joe Biden and everybody else. They have to. They fucking have it, bro. Cause Epstein worked with the CIA and Mossad to get all this information. Same thing with fucking Diddy. That's what this is all about. So they have all the shit. So he has to fucking support him or they're gonna fucking burn him, right? But he can't, he can't like, he can, you know, on the down low kind of say, oh, well, they need to stop, right? But he can't really do anything but support him because if he does, they'll all be exposed. Does that make sense? Makes perfect sense. Okay. And so that risk of losing your entire life. That's right. His whole base went to fucking pro-Homass. And in reality, let's be real. When we observe what's happening, they should. It's a humanitarian issue. You could say whatever you want. These motherfuckers are terrorists. They fucking hate America. They're this and that. That's it. Maybe they wouldn't hate America so much if people actually said, hey, we don't like that they're just getting genocide. That's not okay. You know what I'm saying? Maybe they wouldn't hate America if we didn't send our fucking troops over there to fucking ruin their fucking countries every fucking 10 years. Okay. For nothing. For our monetary gain. That's reality and that's not unpatriotic to say that. We shouldn't be doing those things. We should be protecting our borders and building our country and making sure our people are prosperous and let these motherfuckers do what they're gonna do. And we will be better and more powerful than them. And that way, if they ever step the line to us, we'll fucking destroy them. It's very simple, man. It's very simple, guys, jump it on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. This is American citizens and world citizens against tyrants. That's what this is. This is not fucking, we gotta stop falling for this shit. And by the way, why does George Soros allow to do all these things? Why are these people allowed to fund all this disruption and do all these things? Fund these protests. Fund the sides of them. Fund the prosecutors in these cities that won't prosecute criminals. Fund the worst possible candidates for, why are we allowing one family to do that? See what I'm saying? How they get their money? By destroying countries. Yeah, guys jumping on their conversation, man. Let us know what you guys think. What's that being said? Let's hit this comments. Yeah, these comments, man, are getting fucking wild. All right, you guys need to calm the fuck down. All right. This first comment, we gotta address the elephant in the room. What's that? These motherfuckers calling you out for not training. We've addressed it. What? Tell them. So how many days of row you train? We're at four. You're at two. Oh, two? No, I did a ruck on Sunday. So Sunday Monday Tuesday. Today's when... Here's what the people want to know. I've been on it, bro. Here's what the people, I'm gonna ask you every show now because we're gonna make it happen. How many days? Are you doing it or what? How we're doing it? What are we doing? We're fucking about to become ribs and dick, bro. Yeah, we're getting jacked to 10, juicy as fuck, right? Yeah. But that's not what I was saying that we're tripping on. I'm just saying, I saw some of those comments. You guys could fuck off some of that rude shit. Don't be rude, it's all right. No, it ain't all right. No, cause you know, it is, cause it always feels good to prove somebody wrong. Yeah. Yeah. But they're still tripping though, on some other shit.

They'd have to delete their fucking page bro. That's great. I think that's beautiful. Yeah, but I got away from it. So now we can just do it on the show in front of like 20 times the people. Yeah. Well guys, let's keep this cruise moving. We got a, we got a hell out of number two. Hell out of number two reads. Matt Gates calls for investigation after OMG report reveals deep state agencies may have kept intelligence from Trump during presidency. Do you see this? Bro. Oh bro. Did you see this? Hold on, hold on. Do you got it? Yeah, I got it. Hold on, let's save the commentary. All right. I'm just, I'm not, I'm not really surprised. All right. So we got to watch the video. I got the clips. Of course I got the clips. All right. But yeah, so, so on Wednesday, Representative Matt Gates announced that he was calling on the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government to launch an investigation into allegations that federal agencies withheld information from former president Donald Trump during his time in office. The allegations stem from undercover operation conducted by O'Keefe Media Group or OMG, in which a deloitte contractor working as a project manager in cyber operations with the Central Intelligence Agency or the CIA and the National Security Agency or the NSA have all the secrets about a coordinated effort to withhold certain information from the former president. Now, this is Representative Matt Gates' tweet that he posted out along with the letter, the certify letter that is launching this official investigation into this. But what's he talking about here? So, so James O'Keefe, he releases this video. So here's the clip. I'm John talks about how the CIA kept information from Trump. We're borrowing information from him. Can I borrow his name? We've kept this information from him. From Trump? Yes. He sent me a video. He can't understand people's out loud. For the... Give him a high level of information. We've been never given any information. We do not do no why. It's called Lickfield State Trump. I'm John Fessisi states a high rups within the Intel community, including CIA directors Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel and the upper levels of their staffs colluded to withhold information from sitting President Trump. So the agency's kind of like all got together and said we're not going to tell Trump. The higher ups. The higher ups. We put it this way. The exactly the staff. We're going to buy the director a piece of ordnance. Like what titles are they? They're like this year. Director of the CIA would keep... Yes. Are you guys still watching him? I would say yes. If you guys are still watching him and his tape. Of course, before we are, nothing goes why not somebody wants to. I'm Jed Fessisi also states as fact that Trump is under constant surveillance and even claims they're spying on his ex-wife. And you also have people that monitor your face. That's why I'm keeping it. So you guys have human sources. How do you do that in a moment? Like wiretapping? Is that smooth? How did you guys figure out that Trump was colluding with the Russians? Did you guys use the... Well, he was killed even in Zawakian times. So the intel community was able to use FISA to spy on Trump and his team. And that's how we found out that he was colluding with the Russians. Was it the CIA or the NSA that spied on Trump? So it could be all about it. So you're saying that you're even seeing... Oh, a lot of people. Who's that going to get it? I'll be a lot better. I've done the math. I've done the math. We have a choice here. Do you want to make a math for sure? Or do you want to make some fucking math math? What's the math? It's a state of CIA or really? Fuck me up. No, I became legal. And then I looked at NSA for two years, for a year. Okay. And I was doing some really close cyber stuff. I reject the math. I got you a lot. Could be all the sub-director of national intelligence. First of all, he's into some weird shit. First of all, this bro's got no game. Okay. Like, you fucking old crusty stoop. She must be really hot. Yeah. She must be smoke. Yeah. Because this dude has completely lost all sense of what the fuck he shouldn't shouldn't be doing. Yeah. Which is what happens when you're sitting across from the hottest chick you ever saw in your life. Bro, think about it. If you're stupid. Think about it. He's used to seeing the fucking pool noodle people. Bro, this motherfucker is telling... He put a diamond in front of him, bro. Hold on, bro. He pops a blue tube. He's ready to go. Hold on. How is this dude not picking up that she is legit grilling him? Like, she didn't even do a good job of like working in the cat. Like, it was straight up like an interrogation, which can only work if she's of level 15 smoke. Yeah, she got to be 15 smoke. Yeah. Bro, no doubt. So this fucking moron, I'm John Anton Feseese. He's trying to impress her. Like, oh yeah, I've got top security clearance. I, you know, I work... See, MC. Yeah. Darling. Darling. You know. Bro, you don't want that blue tube to wear off, huh? That's what it is, bro. Bro, he's popped that blue. Bro, what a moron. Okay. So let's start there. This guy, for somebody that's supposed to be smart. Yeah. By the way, bro, you need to go to game school. Yeah. That's some bad game. Yeah, fuck man. But that's what I'm saying, man. He's used to like going running around. Bro, it just comes across as like he's begging for the punani. You know what I'm saying? Like, oh, hey, you know, I'm so cool. She tapped into the primal essence of the man, bro. There's the chase. It's the hunt. You know what I'm saying? No, you're supposed to get them to hunt you. Yeah, yeah. That's real game. Yeah. That can be another podcast. That's a different podcast. But the point is... We'll do that on Q&A. Yeah. The point is, is this fucking guy, like he's already sounds like he's begging for the pee. Look how cool I am. I got CIA card. Yeah, right. I work with NSA. Right. I know all kinds of shit. Let me tell you about it. Oh, you want to hear our national secrets? Touch my peepee. Please. Yeah. Dude, what a douche. Please. Now, the interesting thing here, though, so the CIA, James O'Keefe, who... Please touch my peepee. He's fucking awesome. I really like James O'Keefe. I think he does some amazing and really, really great work. You know, so they call the CIA. Like, they're able to call their, like, the press spokesperson. And the CIA had to officially release a statement on this matter, which James, of course, tweeted out as well. James tweets as, quote, CIA comment, the official appears who have had been terminated as a result of our reporting today. When the CIA was asked for comment, O'Keefe media received an exclusive statement on the record from a CIA spokesperson's date. Here is the exclusive comment. All right. Quote. It was nice speaking with you. As discussed, you may attribute the following on the record statement to a CIA spokesperson. Quote. These claims about CIA are absolutely false and ridiculous. CIA is a resolutely A political institution that provides intelligent support to policy makers, including the president of the United States, irrespective of who occupies the office. We are a foreign intelligence-focused agency and do not monitor the former president, the individual making these allegations, as a former contractor who does not represent CIA. In other words, we investigated ourselves and cleared ourselves of any wrongdoing. Correct. Yeah. So let's talk about this. You got more? Well, I mean, you know, Trump responded to it. Okay. Daddy Trump responded to it. He responded on Thursday. Donald Trump reacted to a bombshell report from O'Keefe media group that revealed federal agencies may have withheld information from him while he was president. The former commander-in-chief said he was amazed that someone could openly admit doing openly admit something so damning. Quote. It's shocking to see how stupid somebody can be. Trump said in an interview with James O'Keefe referring to Amjad Fassisi, the Lloyd contractor working as a project manager in cyber operations with the CIA and NSA who has been tricked into divulging secrets about his job. Quote. Central intelligence agency. This is not an intelligent guy to be openly talking to a woman who walks up and asking questions. Trump acknowledged that Fassisi may have been trying to impress his date but nonetheless urge the agency to fire him. So yeah, I mean, let's get into one. I'm not surprised. But what's your take on this? Well, I mean, look, there's been a lot of evidence that what he's saying is true. You know, Tucker Carlson said that this was true. He got fired like two days. Okay. And it really makes you wonder who the fuck's running shit. And I think at this point, we all know that the CIA has more power than the presidency and the government. Been like that for a long time. For a long time since 1963, right? And you guys can go Google what happened then. And these people, my opinion, what's my opinion? I think he's telling the truth. Yeah, 100%. Well, my question is what's the, what? If you have an intelligence, dude, I think what happened is they allowed Trump to come, they lost the election. They weren't planning on losing. They said, fine, let him in. We'll fucking handle him. I'm pay oh, said we'll handle him. I'll be his handler. I'll kiss up to him. I'll make sure he thinks I'm his friend, which he's clearly shown that he's not his friend. And I think that, you know, they did, I think this is how they worked their way through the presidency, which is a lot of, I think it's probably a big reason why a lot of the stuff that Trump said didn't actually come to fruition. Right? So could be. So you know, I don't know, dude, like I, like real talk, we need to clean sweep of all of these agencies, bro. There should be no IRS. Shouldn't exist. Should there should be no FBI. ATF. There should be no ATF. There should be none of these agencies. They're all against freedom. And they say, oh, well, we focus on foreign intelligence, the fuck you do. You guys got a domestic terrorist watch list. You fucking passed the Patriot Act telling American citizens that you wanted to know what was going on in the other countries. And everybody was like, yeah. And you didn't tell him, oh, we can use it at home too. Otherwise they would have said, fuck off. So they've been spying on us for years. You heard it out of the dude's mouth. Of course, nothing happens unless we see it. That they're spying on anybody. Anybody who's even a man like, bro, I guarantee you, bro. I guarantee you that every fucking phone call I make. I guarantee you that they listen to every single thing that anybody has. I guarantee you that they listen to everything. Rogan says I guarantee they listen to everything, any patriotic or controversial American says and it's like 100% of the time. That's what these people do. And then they were working on, we're working on international security threats. The fuck you are if you were working on international security threats, you'd have the border closed. Unless they can call it international security threats because that would be the definition of the one world government. I mean, here's my thing. You're the sitting president of the United States. Okay. And then your members of these agencies who are a part of the executive branch who report directly to you, right, are directly, allegedly, directly, intentionally withholding information, intelligence. What do you call that? What do you call it? That's treason. Let me actually say you're business owner, right? You're acting in the interests against the American people. What is the consequence of that? Like what do you do with? Well, they don't have any growth. That's the deal. These people do not have any sort of rules or laws or regulations. People assume that they obey the laws. They do not obey the laws. You heard the guy. How do we get information? We fucking steal it. No shit. They don't need a warrant for anything. Dude, these people do whatever the fuck they want. Whenever they want it, there's no accountability in growth. We can't have that. Because they've infringed on a freedom. They're infringing on what this country was founded upon, little by little by little. It's happening in a faster and faster and faster rate. And until people understand that all these CIA movies and all these FBI movies that make them look like complete heroes and badasses are made up shit propaganda for you to believe how they are. Okay. They are not that way. And we've had people who were in the CIA come on the fucking show and explain that. No. These people are not for you. And I'm sorry. You guys that listen that you're good people because I know there's a lot of good federal agents because we know we know who they are. A lot of them. You guys need to fucking take a stand inside your own organizations, even if it means you're fucking job. No. You need to be telling the truth. You need to be blowing the whistle and saying, Hey, this is what the fuck is actually going on because bro, if we don't, these people are going to run our country into the fucking dirt. In fact, they already have. Yeah. Man. And here's the thing, man. So this comes out. There's not a lot of people covering it. This is a massive deal. But what are they covering? Oh, Trump again, won't commit to accepting the presidential election results. That's the main story that they're talking about. Hey, would you do you fucking blame them? Do you blame them? Farmer president Trump on Wednesday wouldn't commit to accepting the 2024 presidential election results. Acquiming comments he made during the 2020 election campaign. Quote, if everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results. Now, how do they, you see how they do this shit with the headlines, man? Trump said he won't commit to accepting. No, that's literally the first fucking thing he says. If it's honest, I will. Absolutely. This is the, this is the fucking Marxist media far left language trick. They try to get you in this fucking hold, right? Well, you accept the, what do you mean? What do you mean? I'll accept it. So, so if I say I accept it, you could do whatever you want. And I have to accept it. Like it's very clear that these people do everything they can to get the result they want. They don't care about the American people. And that's Democrats and Republicans. And so these people are willing to lie cheap steel, make fake ballots, do all kinds of crazy shit to win. And they're going to do it again. And people think they're not. So we as citizens have to make it impossible for them to do it again by showing up at the polls, making sure no bullshit happens, watching what's going on very clearly in real time. And if that's not organized, you need to organize it. That's real shit. These people who they think that, you know, we have to accept whatever result. Bro, do we now remember like the polls right now, the polls are like, oh, Trump leads by nine points. Yeah, he fucking did back then too. Okay. And what happened at three o'clock in the morning? Oh, we had this straight up vertical spike of hundreds of thousands of votes that happened across swing states across the country. We went to bed believing Trump would beat would win the election. We woke up. It was a completely different story. And they had the pipe bursting in Atlanta. They had, you know, remember when they were counting votes up in West Concert, Michigan, they put all the paper in the window. They wouldn't let people see it like bro, they very clearly cheated, very clearly cheated. Okay. And it was a fucking coup. It was a fucking coup. And if you don't believe it was a coup, look what they're doing. People said, that's the best administration ever. What are you talking about, dude? What are you talking about? Are you just repeating what they're telling you? Are you literally that fucking stupid? Well, Trump won't commit to accepting the election. Yeah, of course. No shit. Because the integrity of the election is in question for 75% of America. Okay. Across the crosshounds. Now, they put this fucking picture up. Like he's something like fucking, you know, evil villain guy. I don't know. That looks pretty bad. I thought I'd look at it. I like the picture. I think it's great. I think he should run out like doing the hogan. Sure. I'm sure. Instead of that, he was a WDOT. He does. Huh? Well, say a little dance. I wish he stopped doing that. You know, you know how to do it. The fuck are you talking about? I don't even know what you're talking about. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Little, little dance and dance. You know how to do it. I've seen you do that one. Anyway. Yeah, man. Listen, it's a it's complete bullshit, man. It's complete bullshit. That's a pretty cool pic though, dude. I do like it. That looks like he's gonna come out and Iron Man suit. They tried to use that as like a, you know, true scary. I like it. I think it's a great picture. I might take one just like it. Yeah. That's bad ass, bro. They don't like that one. No, that's what that's what I'm saying. I'm not going to be a man. I'm not going to be a man. I'm not going to be a man. I'm not going to be a man. I'm not going to be a man. They don't like that one. No, that's what that's what MSNBC used as a picture for the article. Post-elect Scruple. Dude, dude. You know, our friend up in New York, I was talking about the other day. Which guy? The young guy. Yeah. He was trying to tell me he's like, dude, they're going to prosecute him. Everybody's going to hate him in this and that. Bro, isn't it funny how the more they push on him, the higher his poll numbers go. People understand what's happening. And these people are painting in a corner where they have to push hard to get the result they want. But as they push hard, these stupid narratives, they're pushing people away. And even Democrats are realizing, holy fuck, dude. This is actually communism coming to roost in the United States of America. It's no longer the Democrat party that I thought it was from 15, 20 years ago. It's completely different thing. And they're waking up and saying, dude, I'm not with this. The more they do this, the more that's going to happen. And so we're going to end up with a situation around election time where a vast majority of people are pro Trump. And I think they're still going to try to cheat the election. And if they do that, I think it's very dangerous. Yeah, very dangerous for them. I don't think people are going to sit by and let it happen this time. Yeah. No. Well, that's what Trump. I don't think the military is going to sit by and let it happen this time. I think people are legit realizing, I mean, dude, you know how many people we get? Like you guys who listen, you know, only people we get from the military that write in, they're like, bro, we get what's going on. You see what I'm saying? Oh, bro, there's police police understand it. Everybody understands it, bro. So what are we supposed to do just to let them do it? Just let them fucking, I mean, I'm not saying they're gunna, but they've already shown that they are. And it would be interesting because, you know, how communism works is like three pushes forward one step back. And I wonder if they won't feel so much pressure that they understand, you know, they got it because they're in a weird spot, right? If they let Trump win, they risk being held accountable for all they did during COVID, all they've done this entire time, especially with them prosecuting Trump and breaking the precedent of former people having immunity. So that's really what I see here. I see a precedent being broken that will end up biting these people in the ass. Right. Yeah. That's black, green, I think that's why Trump keeps saying it. Trump keeps saying, if you guys prosecute me, that means that the president is not immune. And do you not think that Trump's just going to fucking use that same exact, exactly. Yeah, 100%. Dude, these people are digging their own holes. Well, that's the other thing too, you know, communism is like that, but it also will eventually turn into the same way it's been slow and steady. And then all at once. Yeah. I think all I think the all at once push is going to come before the election. Yeah. Well, there's no doubt about that. No doubt about that. Guys, jump in on the conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. That being said, let's get to our third headline. Have a line number three. We got to go back about a month, maybe two months. Okay. There was this headline that came out saying Boeing will so blow or John Barnett is found dead in his trunk outside of South Carolina hotel just days after testifying and lawsuit against the aviation giant. You guys may have seen this. I remember seeing this. I think we covered it. I don't know if we covered it. I know we talked about the airplanes should I think. But yeah, so one of the guys that was a whistleblower, he was found dead in this truck in a hotel parking lot from what they say is quote unquote a self-inflicted gunshot woman. Okay. That's what the cops said. That's what the corner said. They're all on the same same same steam. And this is John here. Now in the email they called his death tragic as lawyers responded saying quote today is a tragic day knows wrote revealing that Barnett was supposed to do day three of his deposition here in Charleston on his air 21 case. Referring to a federal law that provides whistleblower's protection in the aviation industry. Now. There was a. You know, so that goes through Boeing one of their spokespersons released a statement saying Boeing released a statement saying. A spokesperson for Boeing release a statement saying that they were sat in by Mr. Barnett's passing. Now, so you have that about two months ago. Well, then something interesting happened because it wasn't just one whistleblower. There was two whistleblowers. And that second one just just died suddenly is what they're calling this one. A former quality auditor at Boeing supplier spirit aerosystems was among the first whistleblowers will let spirit leadership had ignored manufacturing defects on the 737 max. He died just this past Tuesday. The times reported that Dean had a major role in the case that was in the allegations going against Boeing Joshua Dean. Yeah, they said that he died from Merse or strep or I'm sorry Merse or staff infection and pneumonia is where they said now a former quality auditor. Uh-huh at Boeing supplier spirit aerosystems and one of the first whistleblowers to a led spirit leadership had ignored manufacturing defects on the 737 max. He died Tuesday morning after a struggle with the sudden and fast spreading infection. Yeah. So this guy was a quality auditor and was getting deposed in this case. Right. And all the sudden he gets an infection. And then he gets a little bit more pressure or strep and fucking dies. Right. Now can't you can't you give that to people like can't you well merseys to so staff infections. I mean it's typically like you got open wound and yeah but I mean couldn't you like have it staff and a fucking syringes injected in someone. Essentially. Yeah. I don't know you guys let me let me know if I'm right on that. I mean but the thing is we're like he lived in Wichita Kansas which is where spirits base he was 45 years old. But he was right and there was so much health and was noted for having a very healthy lifestyle. And he died after two weeks was in critical condition for two weeks. Now another bowing spokesperson that came out and made another statement. Our thoughts are with Josh Dean's family. The sudden loss of stunning news here and for his level. Now. DJ alright you got a picture of Hillary up here with moustaches and the skies right you know how the fuck this Hillary have a connection to this I'm glad you asked Let's go back a little bit Because that was this massive expose Hillary is one of the top if not the top stockholders for Boeing Did you know that nope? Yeah, and not only is your top stock broker do you remember when she was the is she still oh Yeah, I mean she still how do you know that do you know that for sure still yeah? I mean like speculating because this article from 2014 2014 right but watch how this plays out okay, so the thing is Do you guys remember when Hillary was was in charge of the State Department? Right yeah, she was she was the right like she let the State Department right you mean right when she said it wasn't a big deal Those guys have been guys got killed right what's it matter right diverse as a make right now? We talk we talk all the time about how these fucking politicians man. They you know insider trading or you know They make these deals and you know that money gets funneled back somehow right we talk about that shit all the time And it's funny because you go back to 2014 This headline reads for Hillary Clinton in Boeing a beneficial relationship so back when she was Secretary of State on a trip to Moscow Moscow Russia Hillary Rodham Clinton played the role of International saleswoman pressing Russian government officials to sign a multi billion dollar deal To buy dozens of aircraft from Boeing a month later Clinton was in China where she Jubyantly Announced that the aerospace giant would be writing a generous check to help Recessitate floundering US efforts to host a pavilion at the upcoming world's fair Boeing say Boeing she said quote has just agreed to double this contribution to two million dollars So she was going around on this little trip back in 2014 right but then something happened Then something happened Russia Folded to Hillary's demands and 2012. I'm sorry in 2010 two months after Boeing won It's 3.7 billion dollar Russian deal Boeing the company announced a $900,000 Contribution to the William J Clinton Foundation Intended to rebuild schools in earthquake ravaged Haiti no it isn't That's a little weird Little bit that's a little bit. That's a little bit weird right like so I guy you know they you go to Russia You're you're strong on the Russian government the Russian government has to pay out almost four billion fucking down You get a million bucks and you get a million bucks off of it to go And that's just this one thing that's just how much other shit today, right? What else that was just that's the money that was airmarked just for Haiti That's right right So and yet like I said I don't know how much she owns But the article that I the information I was able to evolve she is one of the top if not the top Stock owner for Boeing she allegedly allegedly because you don't know right now And then all I'm saying is good old Hillary she does have some evidence of some interesting stuff happening To people who were you know coming out and talking And then you know dying of self-inflicted gunshot rooms on airplane crashes all I'm saying So all I'm saying Andy anything on this I mean, I think you laid it out pretty good bro. I mean These guys these guys are running business the old way You know you talk some shit you get put in a hole and it's very obvious and uh, you know This is That's clearly connect of what's going on anybody who can't see it is a fucking idiot I mean just the timing right like you listen dude. It's not coincidence. It's listen What it appears to be is what it is so simple sense is always the truth. Yes, whatever this so like we could sit here and break it down And say could be this it could be that no Who fucking Witnesses don't just magically disappear when they're trying to testify about how These motherfuckers aren't putting the proper parts or taking the proper precautions to make their airplanes safe to fly Because they understand that if that actually comes out as fact it'll bankrupt their company and ruin their lifestyles so again Is driving the place here Well like but ADDJ what what effects is it having on the case? Well, I don't know if you're a fucking whistleblower and you just seem fucking these two dudes die suddenly And what do you don't want to say anything you think you how how how easy is it going to be for you to get up there? Yeah, but see This is where collective whistle blowing has to happen. Yeah, meaning like when we talk about the agency guys like uh like They cannot stop all that's right. They cannot fucking arrest you all they cannot prosecute you all So organized within the organization and come out as a collective saying this is what it is. Yeah, that's when he's that I'm going to Boeing to yeah, they can't Hillary all of you. Yeah, it's impossible. Yep. That's a good picture. Yeah, yeah She looks better when she normally looks It's fucking improvement I do like the uh the western mustache you like that one. That's a good one like that. Let's go with that. Yeah better I mean she looks you know like she's been out on the range for a while They're all them fucking wrinkles and shit Yeah, man, she's she is my number one. Yeah, least like the person. Mm-hmm number one. Yeah, mm-hmm Yeah, guys, I want you guys to connect some dots you tell us down in the comments. What do you guys think? Let us know Yeah, just let us know man, wrote The most important story that we've covered on this show So Today is this ban of Free speech regarding the anti-Semitism like you guys like if they push that through and that becomes law which it has become law already in a few different states You cannot call out what the fuck is going on? Mm-hmm. So like these guys have lost control of speech What what topics that too? They're not too topic two. Uh, yeah, they have lost control of what's topic one hello on They have lost control of the narrative because of the internet they invented the internet the social media network Lifelog, okay, they ended that project which was run by the CIA then very next day Facebook was founded They invented social media to fucking spy on you and get everything to know everything about everybody and then The internet becomes this way of life for so many people and it's so vast and so big and so fast That they can't control the information anymore and so now that they can't control the information They're their people are understanding what's happening at an accelerated rate. They're losing Gen Z They're losing black community People are aren't they're losing Muslims. They're losing everybody and so they're Response to that is we'll fuck it. We'll just make it illegal and anybody who says it will intimidate and we put him in fucking jail That's the deal there. So Any politician that votes for that is a threat to America And it's the most it's probably the most important story that we've covered in a long time Because it it will keep people from actually calling out what's actually happening and the create in the creation of this one world Government that the world economic forum has been working on since the fucking 70s or 60s. No, you see what I'm saying This is a map. It was a massive step up from just the you know up is down We'll just change the the verbage. We're now making it illegal for you to call it either Yeah, bro, and that means that people need to speak up against it even more.
