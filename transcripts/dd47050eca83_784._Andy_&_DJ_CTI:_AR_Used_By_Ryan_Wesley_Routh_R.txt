going on brother oh just you know yeah yeah working it man yeah working it it's uh we got it we got a hell of a show today do we this is this is a hell I felt like last week was just like we were just kind of expanding and expanding because the topics kept growing I'm excited for something yeah there there is this is a this will be one for the books good boys and girls um let's start with uh let's let's start with something the fuck it let's just get into it all right let's start with some heat all right we got it we got to talk about this lady so this lady is uh going viral now um her name is doctor she's not a medical doctor um but doctor Lindsey Doe um this fun gal right here um man I don't have to know anything else but I could tell from look at that picture some crazy shit's gonna come out of her mouth I mean listen this lady's off the rocker I can tell by looking at her face she is off the rocker bro you ever notice that these crazy motherfuckers got the same face they make the same face they look the same their eyes look crazy I used to have this dog Ellie you know Ellie she had crazy eyes didn't she she had crazy eyes eyes were a little yeah like like dreamy yeah like crazy these all these people got the same eyes man they do but this lady so she runs a page uh on twitter uh called sex explanations okay yeah um and she has a youtube account as well um and she talks about a bunch of different topics I mean this is from her bio here um first sperm testicle trivia prostate massage how to have a clitoral orgasm uh sex offender registry does size matter sex offender registry do your just do it oh sex offender registry I was just reading the ridiculous headlines I mean listen and she's proud of me I Y Dildos I wonder what's included in that video some interesting stuff I bet um but this lady will imagine making your whole identity this shit about sex yeah well what what was the old lady the old doctor uh Jane no what was it Ruth you know some about yeah she came all late at night yeah all a freaky that's her name Dr. Ruth yeah Dr. Ruth but she's free yeah but she wasn't talking like this kind of stuff yeah I mean no so I'm assuming that we're gonna go into the sex offender registry category here somewhere in there okay yeah somewhere in there a little trip yeah let's uh let's get into it because this lady's off a fucka rocker check this clip up org it's short for virtuous pedophiles not virtuous as and they're better than everyone because they're attracted to children but virtuous like having moral standards and a sexual orientation that they have no control over like the rest of us so before you get all worked up I'm talking about pedophilia not child malistation or rape pedophilia is the sexual attraction to children it's a perifilia there's a link to more information about it in the description videos I've made in the past explaining the kind of human diversity and development malistation and rape are different these are abusive actions that often have nothing to do with attraction many child abusers are actually sexually attracted to adults but they act out on children meaning you probably don't object to pedophiles because you're compassionate and rational but you may loathe child molesters and rapists because they violate people I personally try not to judge either wait I personally try not to judge either you should be judging both heavily listen dude this is not real oh this is real oh this is this is this is this is bullshit this is real is real gets is there more is that it no I mean that I think that was all that a YouTube would allow okay yeah by the way I love our YouTube allows this shit but then sensors are shit this was a screen glare from YouTube it's a fucking bill though we blurted that's a deal though that's a cucumber or something oh it was you want to see the original no goes dark listen man this is the problem with the world okay these leftist people have could they they I try not to judge rapists and molesters and pedophiles that's exactly who we should be judging harshly yeah like I hope she's getting backlash for this yeah I mean I mean her little community man you know how these people work man they got their own little communities and shit I mean she's got 20 almost 26,000 followers on Twitter all like minded people but this is starting to blow it up I mean it's it's fairly recent so we'll see how it this isn't the first person we've seen try to justify pedophilia normalizes yeah dude normalization of pedophilia will never happen in this country it will never happen the average person understands just like we understood 10 years ago and 20 years ago and 30 years ago that people who are attracted to children who molest children who rape children are the lowest of the low in society that's why when they go to jail they get the worst treatment even career criminals who have hurt people murdered people committed a life of crime understand that these people are the scum of the earth okay and we shouldn't be making videos about how we should not judge these people we should be making videos about how we're going to dispose of these people that's what we should be doing okay so I mean this leads into so many different things dude remember when we covered this situation the parliament in Spain and they were that woman was talking about how she was arguing about how children have the right to choose whether or not they want to have sexual relations with an adult we have to ask ourselves a civilized human beings not left not right not black not white not gay not straight not any of this shit who is okay with this who is okay with this and those people that are okay with this deserve a certain kind of treatment which isn't good okay and those people doing these things deserve harsh harsh harsh punishment and I mean the worst kind of punishment I mean the elimination of their life that's what they deserve and that's what everybody knows that but nobody wants to speak up and say nobody wants to say hey man we need to read ourselves of this shit in the world this is a this is a plug in our society it's happening more and more and more and more there's hundreds of thousands of children that are raped and murdered and trafficked in this country right now to people who think it's okay and people like this are pacifying and enabling people to do this damage to our children she is no different than the people actually doing it because she is creating empathy or attempting to create empathy for these people so let me ask you guys something whether you love what I say or hate what I say I got a lot of you that listen that are both okay but would you be okay with a person showing up at your door saying Mr. Johnson I'm here to hang out with Ryan and if you don't let me hang out with Ryan then I'm calling the police because you're a big it and it's a hate crime that's why I'm gonna call the ambulance yeah that's exactly right bro but that's where they're trying to take this they're trying with all this hate speech and all this bullshit you can't say this you can't say that you can't criticize grown men dressed as women shaking their dicks in front of little kids you can't criticize this person because it's hate speech you can't criticize this group of people because it's hate speech they're cornering the market and then they're trying to normalize pedophilia why are they trying to normalize pedophilia well maybe it's because it's much bigger of a problem than any of us actually recognize because none of us are in the little sub circles or the subculture or the underbelly of everybody who's in this network and I believe there is a whole lot more people out here that are into this shit than not and I believe a lot of them are very powerful very wealthy and calling the shots here for our country and that's why they try to normalize it so much every single citizen in America every single common sense person every single parent every single non-parent doesn't matter what's your political affiliation is doesn't matter you should be able to not only recognize the danger here but you should be capable of standing up to these people and making it well known that this will not be tolerated in this country at all and I will die on that motherfucking hell bro listen like I mean that's always been my issue it's like how do you if it if it was normal we wouldn't have to normalize it it goes for everything that's not normal if you have to say normalize it it's not fucking normal it's not normal there because the normal shit's already like yes dude the same man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what would you do I want you to answer this question where do you stand and what would you do if Joe Blow whose 40 years old shows up and wants to hang out with your little kid okay because that's where they're trying to take this they're trying to take this to a point and if you remain silent on this and like you have for the last number of years I mean people are getting louder but you're not loud enough if you remain silent on this issue you are asking to be cornered by the law into a position where you can do nothing about it except and if you do you will go to jail that is it and that's where we're getting yeah man bro I think anybody who advocates for this I I think they're part of it automatically yeah for sure like anybody that's okay with it anybody that votes for this shit anybody that that doesn't speak out against it and to me in my book they're automatically part of it yeah because why how could you justify that and they want more of it I mean it is no different than the topic we covered last week about those 158 something democrats that voted in opposition to deporting illegal migrants who rape and kill have actually committed those crimes yeah they don't even want to get them out yeah so you want more of those problems you want more of it yeah got it it's fuck us so yeah man guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's get into our headlines remember if you want to say fucking bullshit man pictures headlines videos links articles go to Andy for seller dot com guys can find them all linked there for you so let's dive into our first headline headline number one new information on the second attempted assassination of Donald Trump this headline reads assault rifle allegedly used by Ryan Wesley Ralph in an attempt to kill Trump is revealed the alleged government accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course had 11 rounds loaded into his assault rifle federal prosecutor said Monday as they revealed the close-up photo of the weapon the image of the soviet design sks rifle that was found stashed and Ryan Wesley Ralph's alleged snipers nests at the West Palm Beach golf course on September 15th was included and they detention memo filed Monday the rifle has been modified with a detachable magazine a modern stock and an scope to make it more accurate to shoot at long range the serial number on the rifle was obliterated and unreadable prosecutors alleged Ralph's fingerprints was also allegedly found on the weapon the court papers stated here's the image of the rifle I'm pretty sure that's electrical tape I'm pretty sure that's electrical tape right that looks like a modified ranch rifle like a rougar makes a ranch rifle it looks like a my I don't know what that is yeah that's weird looking in it yeah that is electrical tape I'm sure what to the people that don't know about guns like they don't understand how dumb that is yeah like you know how hard it is to get a scope cited in right anyway when it's all attached perfectly this dumbass electrical tapes a fucking tube on the top of his gun that is a weird looking rifle it's a weird looking rifle though but there's that and then the court documents they also show you know a picture up close of uh the location the the calling of the snipers nest and then also where the uh serial number was defaced and obliterated definitely was you know so they have that now uh that's cool all right sweet you know so I mean I don't even think if you got a shot off I don't believe it would have been anywhere close um and uh you might as well just tape a paper towel roll on top of that thing bro and uh it's pretty bad but there's something here that happened uh in this developing situation um that I and it's bothering me because I don't see enough people pissed about this but did you see that uh the DOJ uh has released this this hell on reads Ryan Wesley Routh pinned chilling note targeting Donald Trump months before rest quote Trump is on fit to be anything um allegedly Ryan Wesley Routh uh dropped the note quote uh titled addressed to the world in a box at an unnamed person's home in the months before the FOILD assassination attempt at the West Palm Beach golf course on September 15th they released uh the image of of this letter we have it here for you um and this is basically a bounty and I think releasing this to the American people to the world at all um I've never seen anything like this he says in the letter holy shit I haven't seen this yet says dear world this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster it is up to you now to finish the job and I will offer a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to whomever can complete the job everyone across the globe from the youngest and to the oldest known know that Trump is unfit to be anything much less a US president US presence must at a bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America and be kind caring and selfless and always stand for humanity Trump fails to understand any of that dude they release this publicly they put with a hundred and fifty thousand dollar bounty on his fucking head they released it I've never seen anything like that no like the DOJ literally releasing a fucking bounty I mean I'm all for complete disclosure and transparency but this is not complete disclosure and transparency because what's going on with upstein and what's going on with Diddy and what's going on with the rest of the shit you see what I'm saying we get selective things so you have to you want to be very transparent about this though well there's a reason for it yeah because they're putting this out and it then hopes that someone will pick up the torch and do what he's saying dude it's it's it's that's the only reason they could be releasing it dude it's ass and I and the thing is I mean the article continues saying that the handwritten note was only discovered after the person opened the box and alerted authorities and wake of Roth's arrest prosecutor said so you tell me the months before the shooting this guy sent this letter to some unnamed person you guys have and then the person sits on that box until Roth's arrested and then say hey I have this letter the box also contained ammunition and metal pipe miscellaneous building materials tools for phones and multiple other letters authorities who search Roth's car found six cell phones listen to this shit including one that showed a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico Quaripaper's charge two of the cell phones discovered indicated Roth traveled from Greensboro North Carolina to Wells Palm Beach on August 14th about a month before the assassination attempt the FBI analysis found the cell phones were in proximity to Trump's West Palm Beach golf course multiple times between August 18th and September 15th now it's interesting because the first attempted assassination shooter also had a couple of phones with him and those phones were pinged at a couple of interesting places I wonder where else these phones were pinged at I would like to know that let's be transparent about that information they also found a list with dates in August September and October as well as venues where Trump had appeared or was scheduled to appear according to prosecutors a notebook found in this car was allegedly filled with criticism of the Russian and Chinese governments and notes about how to join the war on behalf of Ukraine the FBI's investigation into the assassination attempt is on going anyway what do you got on this man I mean what do you got I think it's pretty obvious what I got I think they're they're not they're not trying to solve the problem in fact they're hoping that someone else steps in and does this look this government that we have is so corrupt and so evil and so desperate this is nothing new this is what I've been talking about with you guys for years and years and years and years and years they do they are they are willing to do anything to make sure that this man does not get back in power and I still do not believe no matter what happens that they're going to allow it without some sort of very real civil unrest or violence I just don't see it happening dude there's there's too much on the table for accountability and that goes you know beyond just the politicians there's the incestuous relationship between the biggest companies in the world the the biggest media companies in the world the most powerful politicians in the western world Hollywood you know saying the music industry all of these things are all aligned to keep this man from office and the more that we find out about all these things we find out that these people are not anything like we thought they were our entire lives these people are completely corrupt they're completely in cahoots they've created all kinds of things they've created crimes against humanity with the whole covid situation I don't think they're I think they're willing to do anything I still think it's going to be rough I think it's going to get crazy and you know the fact that they they redact every single name out of Galein Maxwell's trial or redact every single name out of documents that are released regarding Epstein or Diddy or any of this shit the fact that they don't prosecute people who manufactured a pandemic and then made up rules and transferred the biggest wealth transfer from middle class people to the ultra rich people the fact that they don't hold those people accountable we go on and on and on you know dude they remember whenever they were threatening us all that if they we didn't get the vaccine we weren't going to be able to work they fired all these people they kept your kids out of school they affected their development etc etc etc etc they push this ridiculous backward shit on to society like you know kids should be groomed to understand that you know they could change their gender when they're two years old like bro we got parents now who are deciding their children are transgender when they're fucking infants right okay and that's allowed that that's not considered child abuse or mental illness or anything and we have what we have here is the demoralization destabilization of western society specifically the American culture and it's done by these people and so these people are on a mission to destroy culture and replace with a new culture and I don't think they're gonna let Donald Trump stop them no matter what I think it's gonna be a miracle if he actually gets in office even if he is in the win the election I think these people are dedicated I think they're they have no shame I think they don't care if you know what they're doing the mask is off they understand that everybody thinks they did it and they don't care if you talk to people on the street say who's trying to kill Trump everybody knows who it is everybody believes it's our own government it's our own agencies they believe they don't think it's some whack job weirdo they the average common sense person is not thinking oh yeah well this is just some random you know dork who decided he didn't like Trump right and then and then they facilitate it through aggressive language through calling him a threat to the democracy a million times in a row you know after the first assassination attempt they were saying oh well you know we're gonna tone down the rhetoric three days later they're calling them a threat to our country a threat to this and now when they address these people after the second assassination they're not saying oh sorry anymore now they're saying well he is he is a threat like dude this is where we are in our country this this is crazy dangerous shit that we are having to deal with and you know the average person thinks it's a normal ebbs and flows it's not the normal ebbs and flows guys this is a communist revolution is brewing in America and you're gonna find that out pretty soon and all you people who think I'm some crazy right I'm not even right wing bro I'm a common sense person and everybody who thinks I'm crazy and everybody who thinks I'm crazy to last four and a half five years I've been talking about this you're gonna fucking find out dude I'm still just hung up on this fucking bounty they push out I mean like how long was it before they it took them to even just release two fucking pictures of with the Nashville shooters fucking manifesto we haven't heard shit about the July the first it's assassination guy we haven't heard shit nothing but we got this yeah well yeah I mean listen does he look sorry to you he'll know now he looks happy these people are fucking insane and what do we get everybody else that's not locked step with the progressive left communist ideals I'm not talking about Democrats I'm talking about the crazy ones everybody who's not locked step with them is far right you know I'm saying everybody like this this is this is insane they have brainwashed a certain segment of the population on the far left the far left to legitimately believe that Donald Trump is going to ruin the country he was our president for four years what did he do oh he built the greatest economy we've ever had in America crime was at its lowest there was no wars etc etc etc etc etc etc your life was better whether you want to admit it or not okay and y'all fucking hate the dude for one reason or another and you're willing to literally destroy your own lives so that because you hate this man so much and it's weird because they tell you to hate the man bro it's weird we don't know why you fucking hate him yeah they do I saw a vote today I saw interview today there was this dude interviewing people on the street and this yeah shocking this middle aged white woman and the guy interview was a black guy and he said uh he said who you voting for and she goes I'm voting for Harris and he goes why I'm voting for Trump she goes what the fuck is wrong with you if you see this one yeah and then he goes he goes well look I'm gonna say something good about Harris and bad about Trump and he said uh he said what did he say he said something good about Harris he said something bad about Trump he asked her he said now I want you to say something good about Trump it's not bad about Harris and dude she was like well I have to admit you know my life was easier under Trump we made more money the economy was better but I just can't vote for him and it's just weird to me how all these people know that their lives are better under this one man but they're willing to vote this other way because they hate this dude so much it does not make sense it does not make sense and the only sense that I can derive from it is that these people who are often upper middle class white women who say this shit I don't think they have an understanding of how hard it is for the working class or how hard it is for the average American to go out and earn a living right now okay like if you're in a position where you don't have to go out and like have stress financially because you're in a certain and maybe maybe her husband works or maybe they they're they're upper class who knows but if you're not in a situation to understand what's actually happening you're not gonna feel it yeah if you're not truly affected yeah she's not and you can tell these people are voting they're not affected by it because if they were there's no way they could think that or anybody that you asked that aren't truly affected by they're all saying Trump this is why I say people who don't pay into the tax system shouldn't be allowed to vote doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman or what age you are if you're 15 you're paying taxes you got a job we'll have a young education program for these young voters but but dude there's too many people to vote that don't pay in they don't pay taxes and we shouldn't allow those people to vote because they make it harder on the people that are fucking that's correct so we have this class of people who are working hard putting all this effort in struggling to make their situation work financially and then we have all these people who don't do any of that voting on on the fact that they want these first groups of people's tax dollars you see what I'm saying how how does that work these people who are not paying into the system who do not have an interest and paying into the tax system should not be allowed to vote doesn't matter if you're 15 or 50 or 80 it doesn't matter that's my opinion it would solve all this shit solve a lot of shit bro solve a lot of stuff guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's go cruise these comments we got some interesting ones today this first one is from at jbanda 0 440 so as uh Johnson and Johnson is probably big mad that diddy is locked up distant sounds of j and j stocks crashing I saw some funny names about it bro they got some crazy memes cuz I saw one where it was like we're never gonna recover from

notification on youtube stay up to date with the latest episodes from ilia for that being said headline number two uh let's time travel a little bit uh go back about two weeks about two weeks or so do you remember during the debates we watched them together and uh come queen set this uh set this comment she said that uh there was no us troops in combat zones yeah yeah and then literally we were getting messages me and DJ we're getting messages from dudes like out in combat zone like there were the fucker like what the fucker did you see that one video those guys made where they were watching her on tv yeah and then they all turned around and they're like in the in the combat zone of fucking two where are we yeah she was talking out of her ass so she was wrong she's been fact check plenty of times um and uh she her official the actual statement was quote as of today there is not one member of the united states military who is an active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world the first time this century here i said um but yeah that's not that's not that's not true um the us maintains nearly one thousand troops on bases in Syria alone and another 2500 in our right according to the united states department of defense in Syria us troops are stationed to help prevent a resurgence of the islamic state group they play a similar role than iwak where they also helped disrupt iran's influence and supply lines of various malicious now i thought it was interesting that she had that comment okay she made that uh during the debates national television you know that we have none and again obviously we have some uh in those places and not only do we have somewhere actually sending some more what were three watch headline reads u.s. announces it's sending troops to the middle east and warrants americans to leave lebanon uh this is uh fresh off the press uh let's dive into this united states is sending troops to the middle east in response to the surge and violence between israel and hezbollah as uh and as the region teeters on the edge of an all out war the pentagon announced on monday that quote additional service members uh would be deployed to join the forty thousand already stationed in the region along with a dozen warships and fighter jet squadrons uh israeli forces have ramped up the airstrikes deep inside lebanon uh in the state department has warned all americans to leave as the risk of conflict spirals to levels not seen in years uh tensions have reached boiling points in the last seven days and started to deteriorate when pages and walkie talkies owned by members of hezbollah exploded and they coordinated attack last week um and so uh as of today there has been devastating airstrikes by the israeli military on monday they killed at least a hundred people uh and injured another four hundred in lebanon as idf warplanes pummeled targets across the country um now there was a talk about another uh peace deal brokering a ceasefire but that failed um miserably uh at the hands of this current administration um and i thought that was interested um and so we're sending more troops the troops that you know we don't have in these war zones already we're sending more troops of people that are actually in the war zones and then out of somewhere i don't i don't really know how this piece is in but i thought it was quite interesting um that with all of it happened and you have this headline uh that reads here we go seven hundred and forty one security officials former military brass and warmongers signed letter to endorse comlahairs for presidents to spies who lie 2.0 isn't that weird right in that weird this article uh reads it says president Donald Trump was the first us president since jimmy Carter in the 1970s to not enter us troops into new conflicts president Donald trump is also the first us president to bring peace to the middle east one of the great foreign policy accomplishments of the trump administration was mediating the abraham peace accords um and then we get this letter uh this letter is from the national security leaders for america um nsl for a uh and they endorsed it they uh the letter starts with to the american people we are former public servants who sworn oath to the constitution many of us risked our lives for it we are retired generals admiral senior non-commissioned officers ambassadors and senior civilian national security leaders we are republicans democrats and independents we're loyal to the ideals of our nation like freedom democracy in the rule of law not to any one individual or party uh we do not agree on everything but we all adhere to two fundamental principles first we believes america's national security requires a serious and capable commander in chief second we believe american democracy is invaluable uh each generation has a responsibility to defend it that that is why we the undersigned proudly endorsed com will Harris to be the next president of united states um you know that great oxy moron military intelligence yeah i mean fuck you know i thought i was interested because yeah well look let's break this down here bro there we are loyal to the ideals of this nation like freedom democracy in the rule of law first of all we're a representative republic we are not a democracy okay secondly they are not loyal to the ideals of freedom because we are not free all right and what they're trying to protect is not our environment they're trying to protect their scam which is threatened right now by someone who is from the outside and people enough people have woken up to give that someone a very strong chance at dismantling their system that makes them rich off the backs of you and i and everybody listening here regardless of how you feel about me these people are ruining your life did you see who else endorsed them oh the iris union like that's a good thing you're right put out a press release said oh the iris union supports Kamala Harris where where are which i don't believe has ever been done hold on that's what i'm saying how are we in a position where government agencies and bodies in unions are allowed to speak out and endorse certain partisan partisan president candidates like that shouldn't be allowed they shouldn't into a strong the the put no none of them but they shouldn't be in the correct postal service shouldn't be saying who they these are government agencies that are built off the backs of the work that we the citizens do so how is it okay that these people who operate on our tax dollars are allowed to in a group endorse certain candidates when they are paid off of the buy off of the uh the bipartisan tax dollars that are collected from american citizens that doesn't make sense i don't believe it's ever been done to my knowledge i may be wrong well i think i mean bro i mean for anybody that can think logically which apparently there's a whole lot of people that can't when all these people come out and they put our country in this position and they keep saying they endorse Kamala i think that's an excellent endorsement for Donald Trump yeah i think most people will come and censor like oh the fucking iris oh fucking right yeah well i mean i think the other thing this speaks to you especially with this like this this uh this new endorsement from NSO uh for a this is the military industrial complex and is fucking best like that's what they do and the thing is like you know these who are former servants sworn oath retire generals yeah that all have stocks in these military fucking production companies right that benefit from more wars aren't these the same people that signed uh letter that said that the Trump Russia collusion story was real when they knew that it was fake remember the 51 senior intelligence officers these people throw their titles around like they still mean something they don't mean anything anymore because you guys have lost the trust of the american people you've lost the trust in the american people and adding 700 more don't don't don't fix no it says a signal like okay this is the as like how they said oh we're republicans we're democrats we're this we're that here's what they say we are republicans democrats and independence we are loyal to the ideals of our nation like freedom democracy and rule of law not to one individual or party yeah dude they're all looking at this is this is my exact point that i've been trying to make for years these are attorneys and attorneys operate like this hey we're gonna get them they tell you that the client we're gonna get them they call their buddy over there who's also an attorney and they say ring ring hey Steve these two guys are super pissed i think we can work them all the way out up until the trial and we could build on this and this and they work it out all before the fucking case starts that's what these people do and so what's happening now is and that's not all attorneys but that's most of them what's happening now is these people are all quality each other be like fuck dude we're about to lose our honeyhole we're about to lose our benefits we're about to lose our system that makes us rich we got to work together to stop this shit and so the fact that they're all coming together all these corrupt people should be a very strong sign to anybody who's paying attention that we are not voting for left or right we are voting establishment non establishment we are not voting democrat republican black white gay straight we're not voting that we're voting do we want fascism tyranny which already exists we want more of that that's gonna lead to communism or do we want someone from the outside who may not be perfect who may not be your cup of tea but at least we're not gonna have that right or we're gonna start to dismantle that and to be honest i'm not even 100% confident that that's gonna happen because it didn't happen the first term okay but i could tell you this we have the possibility of it being dismantled or we have and i believe that he will i'm just saying i wish more would have happened in the first term or we have for sure this other thing which is going to continue to take away from our our freedom our life our ability to make money our ability to live the american dream it's gonna make our life harder it's gonna make our life more expensive and they're promising this like utopia of peace love and joy none of which are going to exist at all you're not gonna be happy dude when you're getting evicted from your house and black rags buying it and then they're calling you and they're saying hey i will rent it back to you right you're gonna be happy about that right now i'm gonna be happy three times more you're gonna be happy when you go to the when you go to uh you know buy a gallon of milk and and and it's fucking $30 you're not gonna you're not gonna be happy when you know you think prices are up now and they go up three or four times that amount or when eight you know interest rates are fucking 15 20% and they've been that in this country before just so you know like dude we're we're most people don't even know what the fuck that means anyway but the point is is that your life is gonna get way worse if she wins and it's gonna get a lot better of Trump wins and that's just the fact and it doesn't matter if you don't like his bedside manner it doesn't matter if you don't like his tone i actually like his tone i think his bedside manners hilarious i think he handles the media perfectly they attack attack attack attack attack and he does what he has to do that's my personal opinion you don't have to agree with it but i can tell you this if she wins we're all gonna fucking suffer and that goes for those that fucking love what i say and those that hate what i say those that think i'm right and those that think i'm wrong you're all gonna suffer and it's gonna be bad yeah well man until the point of this even you know while the same time that this you know endorsement comes out guess who's guess who comes to the United States today sylensky and an interest campaign with comala dude like they couldn't make this shit like they they like here's why or i get irritated because they they do this shit so blatant like it they throw this shit in your face and and and and and dare you to fucking say anything who supports this Ukraine shit still who supports it allegedly the shooter that just fucking tried to yeah but dude nobody's supporting this nobody's supporting us sending a hundred billion dollars to you crane when our cities are a fucking war zone nobody's supporting since sending a hundred billion dollars to you crane when we have thousands upon thousands upon thousands of homeless vets in this country nobody's supporting sending that money to crane when our police officers are underpaid our military is underpaid the people who do the hardest jobs in society first responders are underpaid teachers okay why do we have all these crazy teachers because we don't pay enough to attract people to actually make a career that would know how to teach you see what i'm saying so and i know there's some great teachers out there i fucking have had a whole bunch of them but my point is you know we got a problem dude in this country our country's crumbling the infrastructure's crumbling look at our streets look at our buildings look at the brutalism that's happening those of you that don't know what brutalism is look at the buildings from five hundred years ago versus the buildings now why are the buildings now so boring it's not because they're cheap to build so that you don't have pride in your community you don't drive down the streets and look at that beautiful church look at that beautiful library look at that beautiful amphitheater because they don't want you to have pride in this country anymore they don't want you to say man i love america i'm proud of it this made that it's a it's a societal weapon no different than political correctness don't say that because it will offend someone which makes you self-sensor cancel culture don't say that or we'll take everything from you so you're not allowed to have an opinion on anything okay silent majority it's not it's not proper to talk about that just vote with your vote with your vote and don't talk about it we're the we're the majority how is that working out for everybody how's that working out it's not okay this country is big you know when they teach you as kids don't talk about religion don't talk about politics don't talk about money why do they teach you that why don't they teach you how to balance your own finances in high school okay it's because they want you broke they want you confused they want you fat they want you sick they want you consuming their data they do not want you productive they do not want you wealthy because when you are independent healthy wealthy and thinking critically you're impossible to control by their standards so if you start thinking about if they want us weak we are easier to control and you start looking at all the things that they promote like when they put 400 pound women on the front of fitness magazines and say that it's healthy that's not healthy and everybody knows it okay so why are they promoting that they're promoting that so you will consume more of their medication you will be a perpetual patient for life you will have to you will consume more of their data you will consume more of their food you become a mega consumer that's what they want you're a mega consumer for the hospital you're mega consumer for for the media companies you're a mega consumer for you know really everything that they promote the pharma industry fucking everything dude so you have to start thinking everything they do is designed to make you weaker so what should you do you should reject all of that and do the things that make you independently strong and if we have a nation of independently strong human beings it makes it very hard for them to control and that's why they suppress us the way that they do that's why they tell us don't say this don't talk about that that's why in COVID they closed all the bars and restaurants you know why because the seeds of revolution were sewn in taverns when people can talk about what's going on that's not good for them right all right so we're dealing with the situation where we the people have to come to terms with what we are actually dealing with and it doesn't matter if you voted left your whole life or right your whole life because they don't give a shit if you're left to right they're on the same team that's the misconception here they aren't on the same team and they understand that if they divide us into these two distinct categories and they confuse us that we are easy to manipulate and control because we will fight amongst each other that has to stop if we are ever going to build America into what it should be yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three and you call this a couple a couple of a couple of months ago bro and it looks like it might start happening we got to go to Chicago for this one um check this headline Chicago gang bangers rage against newly arrived Venezuela migrants as trend de aronga moves in city is going to go up in flames I'm joining the gang bangers I'm not kidding I'm joining the gang bangers hey man listen this is how we're going to unite dude I think this will be this will be what it is man yeah and and right now and and here's the thing I want to start with this this story this topics not even really being covered in national media and I think that's a great a great mark of of one the importance of this happening um and I think them trying to limit and kind of quash any type of other upriders and this from happening in other places and cities um but it's fucking happening um and I think it's fucking beautiful let's let's dive into this uh in Chicago uh after serving 20 years in state prison for murder former gang bangers Tyrone Muhammad never expected to return to the city's tough south side and find Venezuela migrants in the criminal train de aronga gang moving in but Muhammad who's 53 uh who's gone straight and runs a street patrol and violence prevention program called ex-cons for community and social change says Venezuelan criminal gangs flooding shelters and taking over apartment buildings are the last straw for the struggling African-American community he says they are furious at seeing government money going to what they call quote-unquote non-citizens quote it is impossible to release gang members and criminals into our country through our borders and broken walls and infiltrate them in our community uh that's already impoverished and broken and Muhammad told the post last week on the oblock a stretch along south king drive that's considered the most dangerous in the city quote when the black gangs here get fed up with the illegalities and criminal activities of these migrants or non-citizens the city of Chicago was going to go up in flames and there will be nothing the national guard or the government can do about it when the blood shed hits the streets it'll be blacks against migrants and quote hold on who's been saying that for two years that's going to happen the latest figures show Chicago has spent almost half a billion dollars over the last two years on the more than 42,000 migrants who've arrived since 2022 how much is that per migrant what does that calculate down to I'm not I'm out of veterinarian I don't let me see my calculator 20 wait so 500 divide the two carry the one that's uh almost 12 grand 12 grand per migrant um who who's who's a you had double checked and Chris crossed the applesauce about news a square plus b square okay all right not too bad good job thanks man but uh but but that's in two years all right that's 12 grand that could be going into the resources of those communities right uh continue saying many have been giving money for rent food stamp cards and even cars and some landlords have pushed out local African Americans because they can get more government money for housing the migrants some belong to the one time Venezuela and prison gang turned vicious multinational crime syndicate uh trend day arongoa whose sources in Chicago towed the post are heavily armed brazen and spilling into areas of the south side those areas are traditionally controlled by hundreds of entrenched gangs from the gangster disciples the black p stones to the vice lords latin kings and satan disciples um TDA members flashing gang signs and wearing their uniforms of choice Chicago bulls t shirts and caps could be seen outside the standard club migrant shelter downtown where two local Chicago police officers told the post that they were trying to encroach on a local's gang on a local gangs drug dealing corner near seven eleven stores ten of a club employees told the post uh there hadn't been any crime in the shelter and denied the presence of Venezuelan gang members and not even admitting that the shits happening more importantly there are some interesting things happening that we've been covering our promise you guys will stay up to date on this stuff but there is there there is to your point Andy these fucking politicians in these areas not only do they you know vote directly uh in the opposition of the people's interest they do this stuff selfishly and they're they're all getting kickbacks from the shit half a billion dollars going to 42,000 migrants that's half a billion of Chicago taxpayers dollars yeah right if you think that those twelve thousand dollars are actually making it all the way to those migrants you're out of your fucking mind that's right and it's super important and here's here's the proof we've been covering the story coming out of uh New York New York City where Mayor Adams and his office and his people this shit is wow look at this top Adams aid overseeing migrant crisis response hit with federal subpoena a senior official charged with leading mayor Eric Adams response New York City's ongoing migrant crisis became the latest to be hit with the subpoena by federal prosecutors on Friday according to multiple published reports federal law enforcement served Molly Schaefer uh the city's director of asylum seeker operations how the fuck is that even a position and she's probably getting it's another way steal money six figures for that fuck yes guaranteed um but she's been hit with the subpoena at her Brooklyn home on the morning of September 19th the Associated Press first reported the reported subpoena is the latest revelation in a torrent of law enforcement actions around the Adams administration in recent weeks um now the article reads the mayor's top spokesperson Fabian Levy declined to confirm the subpoena when reached by uh am New York Metro quote while we won't comment on an ongoing investigation as we have repeatedly said we expect all team members to fully comply with any ongoing inquiry levy said uh Molly Schaefer is an integral part of our team and works hard every day to deliver for New Yorkers um these should have said to deliver for these fucking illegal migrants yeah i think that's what but they actually said there's another interesting thing that's happened because i what i believe or this fucking pisses me off this pisses me off bro because people like me people on the right people in the middle we've been called racists forever okay that's not racism okay i'm not rate we aren't racist because we happen to have a different skin tone or maybe we tell a couple jokes amongst friends you know you and i joke all the time about race you know why x is fucking funny all right but when we talk about what real racism is in this country yeah real racism is what's happening to the black communities all over the country the people who come there every two years every four years and beg for the fucking vote of these communities and then go back to wash and dc and make policy decisions and do deals that directly hurt those communities and deny them the funds that they were promised to build their schools and build their neighborhoods and correct their infrastructures and to create those jobs in those communities are denied and then every two years they blame it on the same group and say it's these guys it's these guys it's these guys no these people are the most racist mother fuckers in this country they intentionally empowers and hurt the inner city black communities by their policy decisions after looking them in the fucking eye and saying we love you we're going to do this for you we're going to take care of this and this and this for you i'm black vote for you doing that for 60 years oh man that's real racism is actually fucking hurting people intentionally which is what these people do that is what they do and i'm so thankful that we are starting to see the black communities wake up they're starting to realize that these people who come in there every two years and every four years and all these extra virtuous people who pretend to give a fuck but never do shit for the black communities never even go into the neighborhoods never talk to them never never do anything they just want to get online and say i'm i'm not racist because i'm a i'm democrat bullshit you guys who vote for this shit and continue to fucking lie to these people and continue to hurt these communities are the most racist mother fuckers that exist in america today bro this is my life for by the way um there's a picture of her now what i do not agree with do to do no honest i agree come along i know but it just makes me angry dude because it makes us incapable of unifying if black Americans and white Americans will figure it the fuck out that we're all in the same team these motherfuckers wouldn't be able to do what they do to us that we're all getting fucking fucked yeah it didn't make it super easy man but i'm of the believe man i think what's happening with all this new york shit right because i mean i think the count now is like eight or nine people of his fucking team have all been either subpoenaed have their fucking homes rated i think what is going to come out i mean because new york's been way more than half a billion on these migrants they've been pocketing that fucking money they've been pocketing here's another little crazy issue just a couple weeks look at that woman dude do you think that woman spends any time in a black communities for real and does any no hell no they sit on their fucking in their little mick mansion out in the fucking suburbs and say i'm virtuous i care about dude look at my sign in my front yard listen man if you're a true like listen if you are truly america first you have to fucking care about these inner city communities just like you give a fuck about your own community that is the truth these are american cities that are being destroyed and the people that are in them whether they're black or white don't give a fuck are being fucking manipulated by their own government and impoverished i do i can't stand it it makes me angry as fuck i cannot fucking stand it it's sick man and uh like it has been like eight or nine people i think so far um do you remember just a couple of weeks ago too we talked about uh Eric Adams he uh promoted the new police commissioner after he had to resign from this shit right time domlin domlin this guy here yeah yeah well he just got his fucking house rated by the feds a week after getting the fucking but like bro there is something crazy happening in New York city right now and i believe again my opinion i'm speculating here and when all this shit comes out they have pocketed millions of dollars no not millions fucking billions over the course of time they've had to okay they've had to and dude these are the same people that look these communities in the eye who are importing these fucking people who shouldn't even be in this country okay you want to come to the country legally you want to go through the process like this man here has and this man over here has and spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of their life working to do it the right way only to come here and then have these fucking migrants be given all of this money and all of this eight how much money they give you so I had zero how much money they give you bro zero but they give these people the shouldn't even be here who are raping our women who are molesting our children who are causing crime in this country at a at an exponential rate it's not even being reported because it's so high okay in fact here in st. Louis over the weekend we had a police officer that was killed in the line of duty by guess what a fucking illegal migrant that shouldn't even be here dude I can't stand it officer David Lee he has a wife and multiple children that are going to grow up without their father they're going to grow up and have to live and guess what their father was like because this illegal drunk piece of shit ran him over on the fucking highway because these people brought him here it's disgusting dude it's disgusting you know what's even crazy than that though any it's it's how these politicians in the media try to cover this shit because you go to Chicago sometimes you know what they write their article saying show me where the immigrants hurt you go say that to that man's family go say that to officer David Lee's family Neal Steinberg yeah no shit so while you know these places go say that to the fucking families of all these women that have been raped and murdered and these children that have been fucking molested and then murder and left for debt bro and these people have the nerve to write shit like this it's disgusting bro it pisses me to fuck off dude that's the guy that's the gang guy yep actually he's voting for Trump ex-concert Trump well he must be a white supremacist then Uncle Tom yeah he must be a racist you know fuck he doesn't know what he really wants is what it is bro I'm gonna tell you this and this is just real shit whether Trump wins the election or not culture is culture wins the game and culture has switched yeah culture is moving moving back the pendulum is swinging back to common sense and it and if I'm here's when I'm a little bit worried about bro if Trump doesn't win and that pendulum continues to swing we're gonna see mass violence towards people that have pushed these issues yeah you know what I'm saying and I'm worried about that I'm worried about I've said this for years I'm worried about that pendulum swinging back too far yeah yeah I mean guys I want you guys to jump in on this conversation let us know down in the comments man what you guys think with that being said what do you think I mean listen I think it's only a matter of matter matter it makes my blood boil it make it is good to see people are starting to fucking get it though man I don't feel like we're just you know preaching to the pulpit anymore no I do feel like I do feel like guys like that they're starting to realize who the enemy really is and then it's not black versus white bro you know I'm saying and and the fucked up we have to talk about if we couldn't make fun of each other you know I'm saying like bro these sticks yeah dude like we're all American man we love each other all this shit they tell us we are as bullshit yeah like my guys it's okay yeah we got bigger dicks it's fine we're all in it together you know I'm saying Andy put it here brother yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us start down in the comments which you guys think oh with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show we got thumbs up for dumbest fuck this is fucking man that's for that gorilla shit I really know hey I got a one of setting I can't help but that guy's racist guys about you need to save size yeah I'm always gonna realize I'm what's the gorilla's way I mean they put probably 500 pounds how much do you weigh now 500 I thought I thought there were bigger than that but there were like 350 or 350 you've touched 350 I've touched it I have to I've touched it I have to it wasn't no fun no dude oh three to 500 three to 500 you are the size of small gorilla all right guys our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up for dumbest fuckers we bring a hell out there we talk about it it'll get one of those two options with let's talk about some jobs all right economies you know we know how the economy is people out there trying to search for extra money this maybe a possibility here head on reads I make 80,000 as they do nothing friend for rent to lonely people I do it for pay not pals I make 80,000 as a do nothing friend for rent too lonely so they they say they read themselves yeah people pay them to hang out yes okay I don't know what's worse being paid or paying or paying let's dive into it his knack for doing nothing is doing something to in loneliness to combat the quote alone virus a public health crisis wreaking havoc on the mental well being a friendless folks worldwide creatives and the big apple and beyond are dreaming up unique ways to meet mates but show how mori motos just in the business of buddy making for the money quote I will never be friend with people who hire me mori mori mori mori mori who's 40 a professional rince a friend based in japan told travel youtuber drew binsky's 33 now using an english speaking translator the pay the pal for pay who makes 80 grand a year as tokyo's do nothing guy doubled down on his refusal to ever truly befriend any of his regular customers quote every time they pay said more he moto a married father who began ranting himself to hermit in 2018 he charges his over 1000 clients locals as well as foreigners from the u.s around a hundred dollars for only two to three hours of his awkward companionship and the homey for higher services rarely include interactivity or a comprehensible conversation instead mori motos laid back work is simply rooted in quelling the prevalence of hiki mori syndrome an extreme form of social withdrawal due to chronic loneliness in azure dubbed a global phenomenon by clinical psychology researchers from the Netherlands in a 2023 study hiki hiki mori or extreme social withdrawal as w can severely stunt a person's mental social and developmental growth the findings support a july 2023 report from japan's kio shu university which found that loneliness actually shrinks a victims brain and prompts a series of physical health issues quote social isolation has been associated with premature mortality increase risk of coronary heart disease and stroke increase reporting of depressive symptoms as well as increased dementia risk experts said in a statement the world health organization has to label loneliness a pressing health threat with risk as deadly as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day i thought that was interesting i had to break real quick from this i thought that was fucking interesting because you go to the world of organization um covid-19 physical distancing they were the ones who invented that shit and now that like so the same shit they pushed in in 2020 to force people into this lonely there are a lot of people that never came back from that bro that changed their social behavior completely now they're saying it changed my behavior my behavior complete bro and now they're saying that it's just as bad as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day okay but anyway back to the thumbs up and like more moto west villager is a Bella Epstein 25 is doing her part to stop the madness the genius jenzy makes dinner reservations at swank new york city hot spots and invites random gals online to join her for a bite um a decay to be a friend but never really being the friend and what do you got on this i mean look dude you know social media has destroyed inner connectivity between humans in a healthy way and people spend five six seven eight hours a day staring at their phone versus having physical activity physical contact um love appreciation camaraderie doing things together like just sitting together it has ruined that and again and i know people think this is conspiratory or whatever they think that's by design there's a whole book the chaos machine talks about how the social media companies do this intentionally and then we talk about how they did it in covid why do you think they want people alone now going back to the conversation i had a little bit earlier why do you think they want people alone why makes us weaker it makes us weaker it makes us less connected it makes us sicker it makes us everything they want us to be and the bottom line of everything they want us to be is easier to control okay so instead of renting a friend how about you just get off your fucking phone and go out in the real world shake some hands get some hugs meet some people have sex fuck bro we people need physical contact and it's you know the the the entire social media construct has really made people withdraw especially shy people who don't already yes so like someone who already isn't great socially now they don't have to be because they're able to live this like you know cyber life that exists on this little thing and um you know dude we're not meant as human beings to live that way we're not meant to live our life staring at our phone we're not meant to live our lives in this fake universe and there's very few people out here who have accumulated all the money and all the power and all the influence that make us think that's how it's supposed to be and it's not how it's supposed to be and I don't know what the solution is I don't I don't think that I know this for fact because dude I was 20 uh one years old in the year 2000 okay yeah for real dude I was an adult I know you're making fun of me but that's okay I was an adult before social media and I was an adult after social media I was successful in business before social media I was successful in business after social media I had friends before social media I've had friends after social media and while there is a lot of benefits and no doubt I wouldn't be as financially successful without it I'm going to tell you right now that I would trade all of that to go back to what it was before because you had real friends you did real shit and I I think the younger generation is starting to really understand this we're seeing them reject the hours and hours and hours on social media they're starting to understand the harm in it but like dude it's damaging the society and and here's what scares me bro is like how many young people don't have the perspective of not being around it or what life is without it and it's so much better it's so much more rewarding it's so much more fun and you know I personally believe that with even with the benefits of the internet and even with the benefits of social media I believe it's been a negative on culture and society and I think that a lot of people suffer from this and I think it's intentional and I know it's intentional if you read the chaos machine it'll tell you how they do it why they do it and uh you know it the bottom line is guys it makes us weaker it makes us sicker it makes us easier to control and I'm not saying you should get off social media I'm saying you should be very mindful about how you use it and what you use it for yeah and get out in real world and have some real friends and real relationships and shake some hands and give some hugs you know what I'm saying
